**The Schtick:** This is a Mashbill #2 release from Buffalo Trace that is international only. It is bottled at cask strength.

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 65.3% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Earthy pepper, honey and caramel. Ethanol and toffee.  

**Taste:** Thick, hot, rich and sweet. Earthy, oaky, peppery. The heat is almost punishing, but theres a little bit of balance between sweet and earthy.

**Finish:** Long and hot, with lots of earthy pepper. 

**Overall:** I generally find SFTB to be overly earthy and peppery, with some weird vegetal beet notes. This didnt have the weird beets, thankfully, but still suffered from being a bit too earthy for my tastes. That said, I enjoyed there being more balance here since the sweetness really helped it out. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
