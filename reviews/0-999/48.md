**The Schtick:** Nikka, along with Japanese products in general, is very popular given the current state of affairs. This is a no age statement, grain whiskey produced by Nikka.

**Distiller:** Nikka

**Bottler:** Nikka

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Fruity syrupy sweetness with a touch of butterscotch. Very artifical, though.

**Taste:** Butterscotch, vanilla and sugary sweetness. This has really intensified over the life of the bottle and theres less floral fruity sweetness now than when the bottle was first open. Seems to have really transformed into a one note dram.

**Finish:** Short, mild and loaded with butterscotch. Finish feels a bit watered down though. 

**Overall:** I picked this up way back over the summer because "OMG JAPANESE WHISKY" and I sorely regret it. Its not bad, but its just not that good. This is really my first brush with a bottle that has drastically changed over time. I dont think its changed for the better. 

Thanks for reading!
