[**Review #415 | Scotch Review #415 - 1964 Sovereign 51 Year Old Malt**]( https://t8ke.review/review-415-1964-sovereign-malt-51yr/)

**The Schtick:** Its old as shit. Barreled in 1964 and bottled in 2015, this is a 51 year old single barrel cask strength malt whiskey released some time ago by KL Wines. 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Sovereign

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:** 40.1% ABV

**Age:** 51 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, honeydew, cantaloupe, apples, graham crackers. Vanilla, faint toffee. Overall, its very pleasant. Not super bold, but delicious smelling.

**Taste:** No heat, but a fairly rich mouthfeel. Sweet vanilla, caramel, graham crackers. Faint smoke, but very subtle. Some cocoa and a bit of nice tannins. Not overbearing at all. 

**Finish:** Long, drying and sweet. Very dry but balanced well with cocoa and some caramel.

**Overall:** Im pretty surprised how delicious and balanced this is. Sure, it was expensive, but a malt that age that is also of quality for $400 doesnt seem like a high price to pay. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
