**Distiller:** Auchentoshan

**Bottler:** SMWS

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 59.6% ABV

**Age:** 14 Years

**Nose:**  Apple butter, vanilla cream, honey, gingerbread. Super rich. 

**Taste:** Thick, rich. Very mild heat. Melon, cantaloupe, vanilla cream, honey, mild pepper - all sweet. Some toffee, some raspberry, apples and pears. 

**Finish:** Long, growing heat here but not punishing. Some astringency, pepper, plastic, clove, faint fruitiness. Rich cream. 

**Overall:** Very apparent transition from the palate to the finish, and not in a way that I think I really like. That said, this is generally very nice, and the finish is what keeps it from climbing higher. The nose was sublime, though, and quite delicious.

Thanks for reading!
