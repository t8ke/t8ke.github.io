**The Schtick:** These are single casks of Alberta rye, aged at WhistlePig and bottled at cask strength. This was conducted as a mystery, and I messaged my notes to /u/gleaver49 for the reveal. 

-----

**Distiller:** Alberta

**Bottler:** Whistle Pig

**Selection:** The Wine and Cheese Place

**ABV:** 56.6% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet clove, allspice, caramel. Super fruity, waffles, rye notes. Really fruity and sweet.  

**Taste:** Thick, rich, loaded with graham cracker. Its definitely rye. Fruity caramel abounds...faint melon? Some heat but loaded with vanilla and honey. The rye character is there but its not MGP rye. 

**Finish:** Long, some heat, lots of faint honey and clove. Caramel and vanilla are big here also. 

**Overall:** This is too fruity to be Thomas Handy / Sazerac. I dont think its a Russells Rye. The fruitiness makes me think Canadian but it had a lot more caramel and vanilla than Im used to so Lot 40 CS? If not, a WhistlePig Single Cask? Those are my two best guesses since the fruitiness screams Canadian and those are the only two not shitty Northern ryes I can think of. Guessing proof is 50%+ since the heat is pretty present. 

Thanks for reading!
