**Nose:**  This is also an easy Bruichladdich dram to guess - meaty, salty BBQ smoke followed by more jammy fruits. When I say "this is my jam" I mean, no, probably, Bruichladdich stole the jam from my cabinet. Its a sweet and peaty dessert with light raspberry, lemon, lime, some faint pear and a healthy dose of peat. Vanilla and custard are layered in the background. Much like the 11, its a great balance already.  

**Taste:** Sweet, creamy peat. Brine and wine. That should be a new phrase for scotch enthusiasts everywhere "Brine and dine me baby". But then it sounds like youre about to become the main dish. Perhaps not then...

**Finish:** Long, hot, salty. Not too different than most other Bruichladdich drams for me. Theres some lovely BBQ bacon in there which is where most of that briney salty note comes from to me. Overall though it is long and delicious - like that one magical BBQ you want never to end. Dont let them see your vinegar strokes. 

**Overall:** This 12yr is also a kick in the pants. Powerful, complex, subtle at times (I know its an oxymoron). I couldnt turn down either of these if I tried. For that reason, this dram also scores very notably - an 8 like its brash, younger brother. This puts it nearer the upper echelons of my scale, with the likes of Octomores, Laphroaig 10 CS and Springbank 14yr Cask Strength. Thanks for reading!

Thanks for reading!
