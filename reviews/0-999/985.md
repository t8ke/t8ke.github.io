**Distiller:** Cruzan

**Bottler:** Cruzan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Molasses, brown sugar syrup. Light anise, pepper, tobacco, root beer candies. 

**Taste:** Thin, no heat at all. Sweet. Root beer candies. Chocolate tootsie pop candies. Light caramel, heavy artificial molasses. 

**Finish:** Short, no heat. Caramel candies, fake cocoa, more chocolate tootsie pop. Artificial root beer.

**Overall:** Not great, and certainly one noted in the profile for the most part. This was great in cocktails that focus on other strong favors - my favorite was a dark n stormy with heavy lime. This is not good neat. 

Thanks for reading!
