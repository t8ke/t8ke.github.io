[**Review #118 | Scotch Review #46 - Glenfarclas 15yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-118-glenfarclas-15/)

**The Schtick:** This is a Europe only release from Glenfarclas, nestled between their 12yr and 17yr core offering. 

-----

**Distiller:** Glenfarclas

**Bottler:** Glenfarclas

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  There is a lot of honey and sherry, theres figs and strawberries. Its a syrupy sweet nose and theres also a brief waft of wine. Theres a tiny bit of that Farclas Funk (band name pending).

**Taste:** Much lighter than I expected. This is very very reminiscent of the 12 and the extra 3 years in sherry doesnt seem to have impacted nearly as much as I was inferring it would. Its a bit hot and the sherry gives way to the heat. Theres some nice leather, clove and spice to balance and some thin strawberry to finish up. 

**Finish:** The finish is medium long but surprisingly hot. For the proof, its oddly astringent. Theres some woody spice with more sherry and clove. Its funky, and much hotter than I expected, which really threw me for a loop. 

**Overall:** I wanted to like this much more than I did in the end. Its good, and Im not sure of the price, but I dont feel like Im missing out. Its hot and a little bit all over the place. 

Thanks for reading!
