[**Review #10 | Rye Review #2 - Alberta Rye Dark Batch**]( https://t8ke.review/review-10-alberta-rye-whisky-dark-batch/)

**The Schtick:** Its Alberta rye with some sherry added. 

-----

**Distiller:** Alberta

**Bottler:** Alberta

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Like a raisen + dark fruit basket. I really like it though. Deep fruit notes with a little added sweetness. Very gentle for a rye nose.

**Taste:** Coats nicely on the tongue, more of that dark fruit although there is a tad bit of a plastic taste. Well blended, tastes like a grown up juicebox with almost none of that typical rye spiciness. 

**Finish:** Medium to long, gently falling off with more of those dark fruit notes. 

**Overall:** This is pretty interesting, but not really great. I use it a lot in some custom blends Ive been experimenting with due to the dark fruit notes and Im really impressed with the value. Tastes like a watered down MWND with a little less port and spice.  

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
