[**Review #422 | Scotch Review #422 - Talisker Distillers Edition **]( https://t8ke.review/review-422-talisker-distillers-edition-1992/)

**The Schtick:** Diageo releases special "Distillers Editions" of each of their core line of products once a year. This particular Talisker was aged from 1992 to 2015 and finished in Amoroso sherry. Ive not had much Amoroso sherry before but I think it will marry quite well with the profile that Talisker delivers. It is NOT bottled at cask strength, bummer, but at 45.8% ABV, its not awful either.

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 45.8% ABV

**Age:** 13 Years

**Nose:**  Sweet vanilla, stewed fruits, salted caramel and the briny sea air. Theres really nice fruitiness accompanying the brine - lots of strawberry, lingonberry, blackberry. Nice blend of scents.  

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel but no heat, salt and pepper make a good first appearance followed by stewed fruits and vanilla. Theres a lot of toffee here and the pepper balances the sweetness really well. The combination of sweet fruity notes and the briny salt and pepper makes for a very savory palate - not in the BBQ peat sense but the sweet vs salty sort of way. Really delicious. Very complex. 

**Finish:** MEdium in length but no growing heat. Lots of that blackberry-strawberry along with a good deal of salt, pepper, caramel and a nice oak note. Very savory. 

**Overall:** Im incredibly impressed with this bottle. The blend of sherry and the Talisker profile here is just phenomenal. This was my first Talisker DE and I really need to try more. The notes were delicious and the complexity was meticulous and really well done. Im going to give this a Rank 8, which, if you follow many of my reviews, youll realize that that means this is a hell of a dram. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
