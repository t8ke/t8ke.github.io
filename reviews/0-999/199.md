[**Review #199 | Bourbon Review #111 - Bernheim 7yr Wheat Unchillfiltered Loch and Key Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-199-bernheim-7yr-loch-key-ncf/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Bernheim

**Bottler:** Bernheim

**Selection:** Loch and Key

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet mellow fruit (strawberry, faint banana) - vanilla, molasses and honey. Very light, mildly floral and fruity.   

**Taste:** Thin mouthfeel but sweet cloves, banana dough and brown sugar are three big notes that jump right at me. around those theres a little molasses and syrup but overall this is a very fruity and sweet dram. Definitely a wheater. 

**Finish:**  Short and growing hot. Lots of clove and honey. A lot of those distinct features of the palate have already whisped away. A lot of the depth just isnt here. 

**Overall:** This is a very interesting dram and my first experience with modern Bernheim product. It started interesting, grew really quite good in the palate and then everything just dropped out. I was pretty disappointed because the nose and palate were pretty good. For this reason, Im rating this dram a 5. Its fine and thats all there really is to be said about it. Its good but forgettable.

Thanks for reading!
