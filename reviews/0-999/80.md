[**Review #80 | Rye Review #44 - Willett Family Estate 2yr Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-80-willett-family-estate-2yr-rye/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 2 year release of Willetts own rye distillate bottled at Cask Strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Willett 

**Bottler:** Willett

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 55.7% ABV

**Age:** 2 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla and rye spice. Some nougat and clove.  

**Taste:** Spicy with a mild note of plastic. Vanilla and clove sweeps in with some odd vegetable notes. Cinnamon and molasses on the way out. Pretty green but its only 2 years old.   

**Finish:** Short but not too hot for the proof. Its complex while its here and I am pretty surprised - its a generally acceptable quality finish for something so young. 

**Overall:** This is the youngest Willet Ive had and Im impressed with what they are doing with their own distillate. I will be very much looking forward to see how age treats this distillate. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
