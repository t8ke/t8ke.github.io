**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Longmorn

**Bottler:** The Perfect Dram

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.6% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Toffee, cocoa, tobacco, vanilla bean and butter cream, faint jammy notes.

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, no heat, sweet and jammy, raspberries, vanilla, caramel, mild plastic note there but only faintly so.

**Finish:** Medium, grows a little hotter. Still sweet, sticky toffee and fruity galore. 

**Overall:** Very enjoyable. Like a dessert toffee fruit cake. Yum. I liked this a lot and I can see why it was lauded. If there wasnt that odd plasticy note it might have clawed higher but this was a great dram for sure, nonetheless. Im giving it a Rank 7 to reflect that. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
