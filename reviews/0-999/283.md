[**Review #283 | Bourbon Review #283 - Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve 12yr Binnys Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-283-kc-sib-binnys-12yr/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** Binnys

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sticky caramel, peanut brittle, cocoa

**Taste:** Sweet rich caramel peanut brittle no heat, cocoa fudge, toffee, generous oak pepper

**Finish:** Long, heat is way better tamed compared to the other picks Ive had. Sweet and oaky. What KC was meant to be.

**Overall:** his comes at a sad time. Its delicious, and amazing. Its what Ive wanted Knob Creek to be all along and its very well integrated. Ill need to swap for a bottle for sure, that will be my new conquest, because Beam still will get no $ from me. Im giving this a Rank 7 - it easily eclipses the other picks Ive had that are living slightly below in the Rank 6 range.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
