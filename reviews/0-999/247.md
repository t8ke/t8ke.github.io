[**Review #247 | Scotch Review #247 - Rare Malts St. Magdalene 1979-1998**]( https://t8ke.review/review-247-st-magdalene-19yr/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Saint Magdalene

**Bottler:** Rare Malts

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 63.8% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Hugely creamy and sweet. Theres big cocao here and Id guess this has some sherry influence. Mild salinity, vanilla, poundcake, no hint of ethanol despite the overproof, mild orange peel, some lemon citrus zest. Honey, figs, thin plum, cocal and baked doughy sweets.

**Taste:**   Thick mouthfeel, oily and punchy but relative mild burn for the proof. This shit is delicious. There, I said it. Vanilla, custard, pepper and salt, lots of cocoa and malty chocolate. Fig, date, raisins, sherry punch. Hawk suggested a couple drops of water and this does HUGE things to both the nose and palate. Opens right up and everything goes from bold to overdrive.

**Finish:**  Long, some heat prickle. Peppery, sweet, floral. Mild anise? Thats the floral sense Im picking up. Sweet and creamy, peppery bit and a good dosage of more sherry love.

**Overall:**  This shit is bananas. Not literal bananas but its really good. Its also a very rare dram where water does a heap of good. The flavors are bold and huge. They cater to my fruity, sweet, sherry slut mentality. The mouthfeel is bonkers good and Im loving the proof. This dram blew me socks off since I had 0 expectation and Im going to mourn its demise. Since its old and from what I gather from memory, a closed distillery, Im stoked to have tried some. This is HFS level good and Im pleased to be awarding it a Rank 9 where it sits with Benrinnes 23 and some really old GlenDronachs Ive had.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 9**
