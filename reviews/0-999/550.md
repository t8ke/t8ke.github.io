[**Review #550 | Bourbon Review #307 - Early Times Bottled in Bond**]( https://t8ke.review/review-550-early-times-bib/)

**The Schtick:** This is a Brown-Forman product with a 79/11/10 mashbill. It is aged for 4 years and bottled under the Early Times label. 

-----

**Distiller:** Brown-Forman     

**Bottler:** Brown-Forman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 4 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Cinnamon with a whole lot of fruity, funky, caramel-y sweetness. Banana bread, honey and toffee.   

**Taste:** Medium, no heat. Pretty rich on flavor, banana bread and cocoa are big, backed up by cinnamon, caramel, butter cream and honey. 

**Finish:** Medium length, faint heat. Banana bread, caramel, toffee and cocoa are prominent here also.

**Overall:** This was a really enjoyable dram, but its unmistakably Brown-Forman distillate. The banana bread note is a dead giveaway. I would say I enjoy this on par with or just a hair more than OF Signature, though since there is more complexity and less banana bread shoved down your pie hole. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
