[**Review #877 | Bourbon Review #463 - St George Whiskey 2014 Release**]( https://t8ke.review/review-877-st-george-whiskey-2014-release/)

**The Schtick:** This is a whiskey release form St. George in California. They distill a range of spirits, and this is an older bottling of their younger spirit. From what I can tell, this bottle was bottled when the distillate was 65 months old. For those in the audience that hate math, thats just over 5 years old.

**Distiller:** St. George

**Bottler:** St. George

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 5 Years

**Nose:**  Cereal, lemon lime. Musty cardboard. Faint oak. Weird sweetness. No heat. 

**Taste:** Thin, no heat. Sweet, vanilla. Apples and pears. Super muted palate. 

**Finish:** Short, oak, pepper. Some splenda and artificial candy, like candy corn notes. 

**Overall:** Inoffensive, but mostly because the entirety of the dram is so muted and thin.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
