**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Bruichladdich

**Bottler:** Bruichladdich

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 59.5% ABV

**Age:** 11 Years

**Nose:**  Thick and heavy BBQ notes. Salty, briney and yeasty. There is no doubt this is a Bruichladdich product. Theres some vanilla, haevy custard, dirty vut grass and a tinge of lemon. Powerful.    

**Taste:** Very sweet but well balanced. Smokey BBQ ribs and heavy ethanol. Red wine, apples and custard. Grass and hay followed with winey sweetness and one last punch of brine. 

**Finish:** Long but hot. Complex, though; salty and sweet here play very well together. The apples and lemon, hay and grass and brine and BBQ all blend well.

**Overall:** This dram is a kick in the pants - in a good way. Very very reminiscent of Octomore expressions. I like it a lot and it is certainly exceptional. The balance of heat and flavor and the deep complexity of that flavor to play across the spectrum is really impressive to me. For that reason, Im rating this dram an 8 since it really is quite exceptional. This is a significant hop from the median, allowing Bruichladdich PC11 to sit with some of the big boys like the K&amp;L Glenfarclas Faultline Casks Pick, Laphroaig 10 CS and Octomore 7.4. Ive traded for a few additional samples among friends and Im glad I have a backup for a special occasion. This is certainly head and shoulders over the standard, diluted Port Charlotte core expression from our pals at Bruichladdich.

Thanks for reading!
