**The Schtick:** This is a Springbank that is matured in rum casks and bottled at cask strength. Ive been on a bit of a rum kick lately, so this only seemed to make sense to try. 

-----

**Distiller:** Springbank 

**Bottler:** Springbank

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.8% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet, funky rum. Bananas, mango, papaya, brown sugar, honey and donuts. Faint oak and pepper. Lemon, fresh baked bread, some funky rubber. No smoke, though. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, no heat. Super rummy - loads of caramel, sulfur, funky. Faint burning rubber, bananas, figs, bread and vanilla. Smoke is beginning to make an entrance here, but it is restrained. 

**Finish:** Long, rich, and the smoke just barrels in. Its still not a smoke bomb of a dram, but compared to the nose and the palate its a freight train. This balances the really sweet Springbank base spirit, along with those super sweet rum notes quite well. Toffee, leather, tobacco, rich ashy smoke. Burning wood. Coal. Combined with continued rum funk, this plays really nice. 

**Overall:** This was enjoyable up until the finish, which really just goes all out. It makes me wonder - would a peated rum be any good? Or would science have gone too far. What would Jeff Goldblum say?

Thanks for reading!
