**The Schtick:** This is a limited edition release from Stranahans in Colorado. They distill American single malt whiskey, and often sport fun maturations, finishes, and blends for the Snowflake releases. Named Quandary Peak, this is their twentieth release. It begins by being matured for 24 months in new oak barrels, and then goes off to be finished in a variety of casks before being blended back together.

**Distiller:** Stranahans 

**Bottler:** Stranahans 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  47% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Bright, effervescent, perfume-y. Floral and fruity. Caramel, honey, jam. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Sweet, bready, lots of fruits. Some heat. Apples, pears, light oak. Not a ton going on here, but its fruity and sweet.  

**Finish:** Medium, some heat. Vanilla, apples, pears, faint brown sugar. 

**Overall:** This was really interesting in that it sported quite the variety of flavors but it didnt really find its pace. I know that sound ambiguous, but theres a lot of fruits here and that seems to be about it, in the end.

Thanks for reading!
