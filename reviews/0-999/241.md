[**Review #241 | Scotch Review #241 - Laphroaig PX**]( https://t8ke.review/review-241-laphroaig-px/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Laphroaig

**Bottler:** Laphroaig

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  48% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet, sweet sherry notes with vanilla and brine. Smoke and mild pepper are prominent as well with grapes and date fruit thrown in the mix. Its a nice blend of sweet and smokey with good balance.

**Taste:** Pepper and smoke foremost with the brine and rubber also. Sweet wine fruit and more brine. Its less sherry forward than the nose would suggest but I think its a nice balance, again. PX can sometimes be way too sweet so Im glad they didnt go overboard on this one.

**Finish:** Mildly hot but sweet and peppery. Medium length. Lots of iodine and brine here too with a faint hint of dead things. i like it.

**Overall:** This was infinitely more enjoyable compared to my experiences of a year ago and I enjoyed this quite a bit. Its a great no frills dram and while its not absurdly powerful or complex it does what it does well. For that reason, Im scoring this a Rank 6, just above the 10 because the added ABV and the PX are really a nice booster to the base spirit.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
