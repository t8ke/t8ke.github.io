**The Schtick:** This is my first brush with a Mannochmore expression. It is bottled by Gordon &amp; MacPhail after being selected by Bounty Hunter Wine in Napa, California. It is aged in sherry casks and bottled at cask strength without coloring or filtering.

**Distiller:** Mannochmore

**Bottler:** Gordon MacPhail

**Selection:** Bounty Hunter

**ABV:** 49.6% ABV

**Age:** 22 Years

**Nose:**  Honey, melon, rich nutty sherry. Very wine forward, lots of raisin bread and dessert spices. Caramel, toffee, lots of syrupy fruits. Sort of earthy, as well. Fairly unique for what it is.  

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Lots of honey, vanilla cream, raisin bread, strawberry candies, light toffee and some tobacco. Stewed fruits, tobacco, pepper, some apple cobbler. 

**Finish:** Medium to long, mild heat. Bright, vibrant fruits, lots of honey, toffee, tobacco, apple pie, peach cobbler, faint pepper. Complex and unique, Ive seen few base spirits interact with a finish like this. 

**Overall:** This was delicious, interesting and unique. This is the first Mannochmore Ive brushed with, and Id love to try more. Cool selection by Bounty Hunter. 

Thanks for reading!
