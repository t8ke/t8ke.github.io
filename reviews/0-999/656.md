[**Review #656 | World Review #19 - Nikka Coffey Malt**]( https://t8ke.review/review-656-nikka-coffey-malt/)

**The Schtick:** This is the sister product to Nikkas Coffey Grain product. Nikka usually only uses their Coffey stills for grain whiskey distillation, but decided to push some malt distillate through as well. They appear to do this quite often, given the amount of these bottles rotting on my shelves locally.

**Distiller:** Nikka

**Bottler:** Nikka

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**   Light and floral. Lots of butterscotch - bordering on bomb territory. Really perfumey with some orange peel, lots of vanilla and faint spice. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouthfeel with a good bit of heat. Vanilla and butterscotch are really dominant and there is a light bakers bread note as well. It grows astringent with time and some cassia notes start to take shape. 

**Finish:** Short, loaded with pears, vanilla and butterscotch. The growing astringency continues. 

**Overall:** This isnt terrible, but suffers from the same complex as the Coffey Grain in my opinion. Its one note, a bit hot, and just isnt all that interesting. I dont really expect every whiskey to be super exciting and different, but this is just boring and borders on cloying while also being generally thin. 

Thanks for reading!
