**The Schtick:** This is a blend of straight ryes that is matured in port barrels for some time. It is an annual Limited Edition release from High West, and is usually quite sought after. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** High West

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 49.3% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Deep, dark fruits (cherry, strawberry, fig) are immediate, followed by spice, cinnamon and sweet caramel. Its really quite sweet, mild and well blended. No ethanol whatsoever. It smells like the holidays in a bottle.  

**Taste:** The rye kicks in immediately. Theres a lot of spice and rye flavor that slowly gives way to the sweetness and fruitiness of the port and oak. Theres a little woodiness on the tail end but its gentle and faint. Its pretty dilly, but not nearly as dilly as other releases. 

**Finish:** Medium and gentle. The rye spice is immediate and quite bold but very little sticks around in the finish. Its a gentle melancholy of fruit and holiday warmth all of the way down. For the proof its very gentle and the finish is what really sells me on this bottle.  

**Overall:** I snagged this bottle at right around MSRP and its worth every penny. Its gently snowing outside and it really does do well as a nice holiday dram. High West has quickly become a favorite of mine and this expression does nothing but reinforce that. Its a little more expensive than Id like, but at the end of the day, whats in the bottle is solid and thats what matters to get a ranking.    

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
