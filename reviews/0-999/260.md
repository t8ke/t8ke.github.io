**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Barton

**Bottler:** Barton

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 45.6% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   banana candies (runts), cream, root beer, fruity sweet

**Taste:**  no heat, mildly oily, sweet and banana runt/laffy taffy forward. clove, vanilla bean ice cream, root beer, light fruity sweetness

**Finish:**  Medium and little heat. Sweet and very reminiscent of W12

**Overall:** Good and very reminiscent of W12 except for the banana notes. Its good but low proof wheaters arent really my jam Im discovering - too sweet and almost cloyingly so. Im giving this a Rank 5 - its a good dram and does what its supposed to well. That being said, I dont love it because its cloying sweet to me.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
