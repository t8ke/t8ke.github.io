[**Review #349 | Bourbon Review #349 - William Larue Weller (2015)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-349-william-larue-weller-2015/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 67.3% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet cotton candy. Toffee, caramel, pepper, vanilla and a hint of clove. Definitely less fruity than the 2016 and a little more peppery. The ethanol is very aggressive here also.

**Taste:** Sweet buttery toffee. Thick, rich mouthfeel. Peppers, some clove, a whole bunch of creamy icing. The proof here is a bit on the hot side, but still not punishing. Less tame than the 2016, though.

**Finish:** Long, rich and layered. Nice and sweet with some good peppery balance. Really quite nice.

**Overall:** This is a phenomenal product. Its not as balanced or complex as the 2016 release but that is a far cry from making this a bad product. I love the notes here and this stands to be the only wheater that I really enjoy to this level. Im giving this a Rank 8. Still a wonderful dram.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
