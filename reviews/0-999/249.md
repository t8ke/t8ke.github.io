[**Review #249 | Bourbon Review #137 - Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style**]( https://t8ke.review/review-249-old-forester-1920/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Brown-Forman

**Bottler:** Brown-Forman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 57.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Huge brown sugar and maple, dough, cinnamon toast

**Taste:**   Hot hot hot and loaded with clove, cinnamon, brown sugar, mild mild banana, doughy yeasty sweets

**Finish:** Long, hot, and loaded with molasses.

**Overall:** To me, this is just fine. I enjoy that its proofed up and its done the juice well but its also kind of a one trick pony hot mess to me. A really hot piece of cinnamon sugar toast. For $60 its pretty hard to justify over more complex, less expensive drams. Ill be generous and give it a 6. I toyed long and hard with giving it a 5 but I think it is above average. It is a little rough, but brown forman juice at higher proof does show improvement - I think I just wish it had a little more age. All in all, I think Id rather have Bookers, though. Even Knob Creek SiB Reserve which packs some serious heat, is preferable to this though.

Thanks for reading!
