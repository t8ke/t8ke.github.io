**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Aultmore

**Bottler:** Cadenheads

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 54.1% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sharp pepper, citrus and sweet cream, mild char and a hint of smoke. Kind of smells like someone left a bowl of lemons and limes on the grill. Charred citrusy sweet.

**Taste:** Pretty rich for the proof. The smoke and char is more evident here but it balances very well with the light doughy sweetness and the citrus punch. This is very distinctive and Im enjoying it quite a bit due to its uniqueness.

**Finish:** Medium long and still well balanced as it goes. Theres more smoke here but just enough citrus sweet remains. I get a lot of pepper here, some lemon and lime candy notes and some light butter cream. It grows smokier and more peppery as the finish lingers and it makes for a nice balance.

**Overall:** This is a very unique bottle and I have no regrets in picking it up. It does what it does very well and Im a fan of the unique profile. Would I reach for this every day? Probably not. But for the right mood, its a great pick. I also wouldnt pay original sticker price but Im very content that it was money well spent for the price. The pepper, smoke and citrus makes this a new profile to me and I enjoyed it thoroughly. For all of these reasons, Im rating this dram a 6 - a cut above.

Thanks for reading!
