**The Schtick:**  Wild Turkey 101 is a NAS offering bottled at 101proof. The mash is standard but barrel entry proof varies based on the era in which the barrels were laid down.

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.5% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Clove, leather, this one is really quite musty. Very musty compared to the previous. Vanilla, butterscotch, rotting fruit, bananas, dough. This one smells really musty and sweet with only the tiniest hint of that distinguishing Turkey clove and spice. I think the RNG might have dig deep in the age here. As this smells easily the oldest so far.

**Taste:** Thick, oily. No heat. Sweet dough, caramel. Theres the clove, pepper, some spice. Almost a faint nip of salinity. really strong tobacco notes. Pleasant overall with some nice cocoa undertones. Grows pretty tannic leaving my palate feeling dry.

**Finish:** Long but the heat is growing. Not overly hot, but its there compared to the palate. Theres a fair bit of bitterness here also. In fact, it grows quite bitter but that seems to be matched with even quantities of cocoa, pepper, vanilla and toffee. Oaky tannins here seem to really start dominating here at the end.

**Overall:** Overall, this is very different so far. I think this might be the ol 81. Its completely different in that its a cocoa bomb with lots of sweet musty tobacco notes and little spice compared to other samples Ive had. The finish was a let down, though, with that a greater than pleasant amount of tannins, bitterness and astringency. All in all, I liked it a bit but the finish really crippled it in my eyes.

Thanks for reading!
