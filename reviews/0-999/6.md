[**Review #6 | American Review #6 - High West Bourye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-6-high-west-bourye-2015/)

**The Schtick:** This is a "bourye" - or, rather, a blend of Bourbon and Rye. From 2015

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** High West

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Much spice. Also some oaky wood and a nice peppery kick 

**Taste:** A nice complex vanilla, caramel rye blend. I really like this over a lot of the other ryess that I have. Theres some alcohol burn but it really compliments the rye kick well and doesnt make me feel like Ive just done a beer bong straight from a gas pump. Theres a lot of depth and complexity, vanilla, toffee, some cocoa, nice rye clove. Its sweet and its also got enough spice to balance very well. 

**Finish:** Everything blends nicely on the way out, theres a lingering spicy vanilla note all the way down and each sip Im left hoping for another. 

**Overall:** I have several of High Wests ryes but I think Bourye is my favorite, to date. It also consistently towers all over a lot of the other standard ryes that I have. Plus Im partial to the jackelope, so theres that. 

Thanks for reading!
