**The Schtick:** This is a core line product from Benriach carrying a nice age statement and another funny name. This is their 25yr product, non-chill filtered, not colored and bottled at 46% ABV.

**Distiller:** Benriach 

**Bottler:** Benriach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 25 Years

**Nose:**  Honey, rich toffee, plums. Stewed fruits, caramel, cereal and cocoa. Really rich, faint smoke and ash here.   

**Taste:** Medium thickness, no real heat. Rich toffee and peat smoke. Faintly fruity, blackberry and currants. Pepper, nice oak presence. Smoke really grows the longer it sits in the mouth. Nice integration, overall. 

**Finish:** Medium length, more peat with time. Caramel, honey and dough give way to ash.

**Overall:** Nice and rich dram, although it starts really complex and slowly becomes a pleasantly dry, ashy dram by the very end. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
