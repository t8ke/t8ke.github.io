[**Review #570 | Bourbon Review #321 - Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve NASA Liquors Rosewater Rapture**]( https://t8ke.review/review-570-knob-creek-single-barrel-reserve-nasa-rosewater-rapture-10yr/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 10 year old store pick done jointly by NASA liquors in Texas and Rosewater. As of right now, it sports some of the cooler labeling that is out there for Knob Creek picks - a custom back graphic and name that describe the pick and where it was selected from. 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** NASA

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Creme brulee. Caramel, toffee, faint strawberries and cream fruitiness. Theres some sweet woodiness, faint oakiness and a hint of ethanol. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich - Caramel and toffee steal the show here. Lots of dessert notes like toffee, faint nougat, cocoa and some all spice. The heat is pretty mild given the proof. The faint oakiness from the nose stays faint here, which is perfect. 

**Finish:** Medium length, faint heat, but loaded with caramel, toffee and some fudge notes.

**Overall:** I really enjoyed this one. 10 years is a good age and shows a great blending of sweet dessert notes and just a hint of oak. Really well done. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
