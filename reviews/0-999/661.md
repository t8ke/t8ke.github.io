[**Review #661 | Gin Review #2 - Tanqueray Old Tom Gin**]( https://t8ke.review/review-661-tanqueray-old-tom-gin/)

**The Schtick:** This product reboot supposedly comes from Charles Tanquerays famed recipe book. This is a Limited Edition run, with no real information on when we might see it again after this release. It has been some time since Tanqueray sold an Old Tom style gin.

-----

**Distiller:** Tanqueray

**Bottler:** Tanqueray

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 47.3% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Light citrus notes, hefty juniper and some lovely honey and black pepper. 

**Taste:** Rich and full bodied mouthfeel - the proof is doing positive favors here. The sweetness is very apparent, but far from cloying, with more citrus peel, some lime, strong juniper presence and a butter cream sweetness near the end. 

**Finish:** Finish is medium length, mild in terms of heat and the juniper and pepper presence grow. This balances very nicely with the good deal of sweetness left from the palate. 

**Overall:** Im glad I picked this up, admittedly on a whim, because it has become a really strong go-to gin. Its unique, makes for really interesting cocktail exposure and works great neat or with a cube as well. I had concerns with the sweetness, but there was enough other character to make it an interesting characteristic and not a dominating factor. 

Thanks for reading!
