**The Schtick:** 1792 Full Proof is typically a small batch, proofed release from Barton in Kentucky. Bottled at 125pf, it is hard to tell what the original barrel proof was for these releases, but all the same, 62.5% ABV isnt a bad number to run with. This is very similar to Knob Creeks Single Barrel Reserve, which is a release consistently diluted to 60% ABV and I like those all the way from fine to amazing. In this series, Im comparing a variety of Single Barrel releases from the Full Proof lineup, selected by various stores, vendors and societies in the USA.

**Bottler:** Barton

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 62.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, clove, orange peel. Caramel, toffee, light ethanol. Light cornbread.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Lead with waffle cone, light nutty caramel. lots of tobacco, pepper, and some rich fruits like prune, date and cherry. Lots of oak at the end. 

**Finish:** Medium in length, dry and oaky with a nice orange body. Some pepper, lots of cocoa. 

**Overall:** This was really interesting, and all over the map in a very off profile way for most bourbon. I enjoyed it a lot, but it may be too dry for some. 

Thanks for reading!
