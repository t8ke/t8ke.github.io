**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Glenturret

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 21 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  sweet perfume, vanilla, butterscotch, very floral, fruit cocktail, toffee

**Taste:** Thin mouthfeel, sweet fruity floral bouquet, vanilla, peaches plums, mild pepper, strawberry. Like a canned fruit cocktail. Light floral fruity sweet, very nice.

**Finish:** Medium but wildly complex. Lots of layers which is surprising for proof. Lemons and peaches for days.

**Overall:** This is a great dram. It dances around a huge variety of floral, fruity sweet flavors. I want to take this outside and drink it in my hammock every evening in the spring. Really impressive and considering this is my first brush with Glenturret...im very pleased. Dare I ask for this at CS now?

Thanks for reading!
