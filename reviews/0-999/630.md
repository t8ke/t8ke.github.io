**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 65.95% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet caramel, confectioners sugar, faint oak but not much. Very sweet, very syrupy sugary sweet nose. 

**Taste:** Thick mouthfeel, some heat, lots of confectioners sugar. Faint cherry character - lots of other fruitiness also, namely the passion fruit I generally get in Mashbill 1 products. Heat grows with time as some faintly oaky and peppery notes rise

**Finish:** Medium, growing slightly bitter. Some astringency. Delightful fruitiness with lots of toffee and caramel. 

**Overall:** This is a good bottling but the fire and rage of Stagg Jr is still real. Its hot but complex and thankfully the heat fades with airtime. Very nice and it delivers a great profile for a generally available, generally affordable barrel proofer from the Buffalo.

Thanks for reading!
