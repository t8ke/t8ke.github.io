**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Laphroaig

**Bottler:** Laphroaig

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  48% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Mild peat smoke, creamy sweetness. Some faint jammy fruits like raspberry, cherry, fig. mild pepper, sea air. Everything is there but sort of toned down.

**Taste:** Oily but mild - nothing too epic here. Sweet, peppery with some mild brine. Mild sherry fruit and a little dab of cocoa. Sea air, some seafood notes.

**Finish:**   Medium and mildly astringent. More flavor than lore but its fruitier and the pepper, smoke and brine take a back seat.

**Overall:** I was really hoping this would punch closer to Quarter Cask than Lore but to me this dram is more like Lore. Theres not a lot here. Its on the same plane as the 10yr to me but I think Id prefer to have a bottle of Quarter Cask. This bottle is also priced similar to Cairdeas here and there is no day of the week Id pick this up over any Cairdeas I can get my paws on. They just have so much flavor compared to this muted and pretty toned down bottle. For this reason, Im giving this dram a rank 5. Its perfectly fine, but I dont feel a need to buy it over the 10 (which is $30 cheaper) and I feel like the 10 has more flavor anyways.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
