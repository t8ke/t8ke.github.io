[**Review #682 | Scotch Review #233 - Johnnie Walker Black 1970**]( https://t8ke.review/review-682-johnnie-walker-black-label-1970/)

**The Schtick:** This is a very old bottling of a very common product. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Johnnie Walker

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet bready sweetness. Vanilla, honey, really prominent sherry sweetness. Nutty and delicious. Almost a complete lack of smoke. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, nice glazed donut / bakery sweets. Really nice sherry influence, surprising its here but its very evident. Faint leathery tobacco, very faint smoke. 

**Finish:** Short, mild and sweet. Honey, faint sulfur and a nice stewed fruits exit. 

**Overall:** Really shockingly different from modern Johnnie Walker Black. Not so much different or gradually changed with time. This is a night and day difference with a wildly different profile. I dig it. Its delicious. 

Thanks for reading!
