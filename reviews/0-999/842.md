**The Schtick:** "Chateau de la Grangerie is a property that was built in the 17th century right next to an old monastery. The church and the housing for its servants was actually built in the 11th and 12th centuries and since the Armagnac is aged inside that facility, it might be the only spirit at K&amp;L matured on hallowed grounds. Like many Tenereze producers, Grangerie distills only ugni blanc for its brandies. However, the sandy and gravel-rich soils are much more like the terrain found in the Bas-Armagnac. They fill about ten barrels a year; two of which are used for Floc de Gascogne and one goes to Pruneau: a prune-flavored brandy made by macerating the Armagnac with the dried fruit also grown on the property." - KLWines Website

**Distiller:** Chateau de la Grangerie Leon Beyries

**Bottler:** Chateau de la Grangerie Leon Beyries 

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 50 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Caramel, pepper, potpourri, oaky pepper, grape jam 

**Taste:** Medium, some heat. Oaky, peppery, dry tannins and spice. Grape jam and grape candies. I was expecting a bit more diversity here in the palate, but oak, pepper and jammy grape fruit notes really settles into being the dominant gamut of flavors. 

**Finish:** Long but hot and peppery. Oaky, dry. Grape candies. 

**Overall:** A bit hot, especially for the age. I think this may be the the point at which weve hit overoaked. The grape candy note was strange too, but played well with the spice, and pepper. If it was a bit less oaky, I think Id have liked it more. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
