**The Schtick:** This is an interesting Bourbon, sourced from Kentucky and finished, then barreled, by Prohibition Spirits under the Hookers House line. It is 4 years old, before it makes a hop and a skip over to California for a 9 month stay in Schug Pinot Noir barrels. It features a pretty robustly rye forward mashbill, clocking in at 54% corn and 46% rye.

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Prohibition Spirits

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Corn, wet grass, caramel, honey, cocoa, skittles candy, confectioners sugar. Jammy. 

**Taste:** Thin, mild heat, floral, grassy. Young, but without a super musty, disgusting cardboard note. Jammy fruits, wine is evident. Like a young bourbon and a juicy oregon Pinot met in an alley. Caramel, some faint oak.

**Finish:** Short, some caramel, oak, tobacco, brown sugar, jammy cherry.  

**Overall:** Not bad, but not great. Still a bit young and it shows, but theres enough wine influence and oak to fend off the crap craft young notes. If this was double the age, I bet they would be in great shape. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
