-----

**Distiller:** Clynelish

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 56.3% ABV

**Age:** 20 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Strong honey, honey roasted peanuts. Waxy fruits, DOLE fruit syrup. Nutty sherry. Toffee, waffle cone, apples and pears. Really evident sherry influence here on the nuttier, more toffee forward side blending with Clynelishs signature waxy fruit syrup notes. 

**Taste:** Caramel, honey, nutty. Rich sherry here as well. Thick mouth feel, no real heat. Apples, pears, berries, currants and blackberries. Dole fruit syrup, faint ash, pepper, tobacco and a nice waxy pear note. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet, nutty and rich. Pepper, tobacco and some ash makes an appearance here to blend nicely with rich stewed fruits and some waxy apple syrup notes. 

**Overall:** This was really a phenomenal bottling, showing off some of the things I love most about Clynelish.

Thanks for reading!
