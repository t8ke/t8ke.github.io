**Nose:**  Faint ethanol, buttered rolls. Honey, toffee and rich sherried fruits. Its not at all like a sherry bomb, more light dessert with some sherry in the background. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Pepper, vanilla and toffee are the big notes here. There is some sherry character - notably figs, raspberries and light blackberry - but its mostly backseat to the rich Irish profile. Theres a lot of buttery caramel, doughy cake / dinner rolls, and toffee. The sherry is faint. 

**Finish:** Short, but sweet. Sherry is faint, but blends nicely with big caramel toffee notes, and some leather. 

**Overall:** I really waffled back and forth over the life of this bottle. Some days I was bored, some days I liked it. I bought it hoping for the Redbreast character and a really notable sherry presence. That really isnt what I got. The sherry finish is not bold, but I grew to appreciate that there is nice balance here. Irish whiskey typically isnt the most robust or complex spirit out there, at least in my opinion, but I found the sherry being restrained added a nice level of complexity. In wavering between a 5 and a 6, Im giving this a 6/10.

Thanks for reading!
