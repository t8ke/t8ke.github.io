[**Review #798 | Rye Review #438 - Pinhook Straight Rye Lot 001**]( https://t8ke.review/review-798-pinhook-straight-rye-lot-001/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 2 year MGP distilled 95/5 rye. The name is both coincidental and ironic, given the definition of pinhooking in the Midwest. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Pinhook

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 46.25% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Grassy, minty, floral, pretty muted overall. 

**Taste:** Clove, mint, young corn and cream. Dilly, artificially sweet. Minty. 

**Finish:** Short, also muted, clove and then just minty. 

**Overall:** Not really surprising on all fronts. Like other very young MGP ryes it is young, minty, wispy and generally not remarkable. That said, it isnt super bad, either, like some attempts to sell super young MGP. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
