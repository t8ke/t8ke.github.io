[**Review #270 | Rye Review #148 - Smooth Ambler Old Scout 10yr Limited Edition Gift Shop Rye**]( https://t8ke.review)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Smooth Ambler

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 62.2% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Thick, rich molasses, brown sugar, clove and gingerbread. Its huge and I can tell this is going to be a big dram. Oddly enough, theres little dill on the nose which is what usually gives MGP away in smooth ambler rye.

**Taste:** Huge, rich, dill, molasses, spices and clove syrup. Theres a ton of brown sugar, chick oily mouthfeel. Its all here. Theres dill and mint and they play well with the sweetness of the brown sugar and the spicy rye notes. Hnnnng

**Finish:** Long, theres significant prickly heat here but for the proof its not bad. More dill here but balanced well as the dram grows sweeter. Im left with a long, drying rye spice sensation and I"m in love.

**Overall:** This is some of the best rye Ive ever had and it sits nobly up there and a bit beyond WP CS Rye and THH. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 9**
