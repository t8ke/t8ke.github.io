[**Review #812 | Rum Review #30 - Fortuitous Union**]( https://t8ke.review/review-812-fortuitous-union-cask-strength-blended-rum/)

**The Schtick:** Fortuitous Union is a blend of Trinidad rum and cask strength rye, finished in a bourbon barrel and bottled at 103 proof. The rum was 12 years old and the rye was 5 years old, when they were blended together by accident at at their bottling facility. This is their first release.

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Fortuitous Union

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 51.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Caramel, sugary fruits, melon, clove, 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. No heat. Banana, molasses, rye spices and clove. Faint melon. Brown sugar. 

**Finish:** Short, grows hot and spicy. Anise, minty brown sugar.

**Overall:** Complex and interesting but thin and a bit hot for what it is trying to be. Overall, I think that there is a lot of potential here, but I dont know if rye is a great companion to most rum profiles. You can count me in the crowd that is disappointed that this wasnt bottled as planned - as a 12yr rum finished in undisclosed KY bourbon barrels - but I found this to be alright, all the same.

Thanks for reading!
