[**Review #396 | Rye Review #396 - Hudson Maple Cask Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-396-mystery-bourbon-blend/)

**The Schtick:** Is there one?  

-----

**Distiller:** Hudson

**Bottler:** Hudson

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Young, green, wet cardboard. Oats, damp grass. It smells young, musty and green.  

**Taste:**  Sweet, sweet, sweet. Funky maple notes but artifically grassy and damp. Cardboard, green, astringent. oddly like what Id picture cardboard soaked in Aunt Jemima imitation syrup would be like blended up and diluted with street runoff. Entirely un-enjoyable.  

**Finish:** Short, but still, somehow, far too long. Acetone and astringency are big here as is regret and more wet young rye cardboard notes.  

**Overall:** I dont know why I subjected myself to the entire dram but I secretly hoped it would improve. "More airtime", I told myself. Well, that was a mistake. This is entirely awful, completely young and absolutely without much merit at all. Its a young, underdeveloped rye with some maple finishing tacked on in hopes to mask some of the awful character. It fails. I can think of only a few things Ive had as bad as this.

Thanks for reading!
