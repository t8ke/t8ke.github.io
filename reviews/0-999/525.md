[**Review #525 | World Review #12 - Kavalan Solist Sherry Cask**]( https://t8ke.review/review-525-kavalan-solist-sherry-cask/)

**The Schtick:** This is a young Taiwanese whiskey aged in sherry and bottled at cask strength. It is aged in Oloroso. 

-----

**Distiller:** Kavalan

**Bottler:** Kavalan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 59.4% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Huge, rich, sherry on the nose. Syrupy, stewed fruits, honey, sulfur, pepper, Dole syrup. Its sherry kicked up to 11.  

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, rich sherry fruits. Sulfur is powerful here, lots of pepper, dry oak, tobacco and earthy cocoa. No underlying base spirit character at all - its almost just a vehicle to get the most sherry possible to the consumers palate. 

**Finish:** Medium and super sweet - syrupy sherry is just dominating while the sulfur pounds your palate. 

**Overall:** This is unusual in that I think Ive finally found a sherry bomb thats too sherry. A lot of the big guns in this sphere - GlenDronach and Glenfarclas walk the fine line between powerful and dominating and they do it with excellence. This is a clear example of a dram being dominated by sherry. Its going to need to be more complex next time in order to score better. Im looking forward to trying the other Kavalan expressions I have lined up, though.

Thanks for reading!
