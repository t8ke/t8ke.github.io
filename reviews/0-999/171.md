**The Schtick:** Octomore Release 7.3 is 100% all Islay made - distilled from grains harvested at the Octomore farm on Lorgba. Gesundheit. It is peated, pre-distillation, to 169PPM and then aged in ex-bourbon and spanish wine casks. Bruichladdich tells us that these are Ribera Del Duero wine casks. I only know what some of those words mean.

**Distiller:** Bruichladdich

**Bottler:** Bruichladdich

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 58.7% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years

**Nose:**  Massive peat and pepper. Salty, briney lemons and vanilla pound cake. Yep its an Octo, here we go! The BBQ sets in with some sweet savory meaty notes and then a hint of fudge. A bit more lemon, zesty this time and then that Octomore pepper swings back for one more punishing blow. 

**Taste:** Ethanol, lemon and salt. Sounds like a cocktail. Theres some hay and veggie notes with the pepper and the smoke. Lots of dough and vanilla. Creamy and sweet with some tart to accompany. I imagine this tastes like 

**Finish:** Long and creamy. A bit of heat, but at 126proof, Im not bothered. Custard, smoke and more BBQ. It lumbers away with one last hit of zesty lemon and pepper. 

**Overall:** I want to not like Octomore. Its young and it is expensive. But boy is it good. Its powerful. Punishing. Offensive. And I love it. To me, it is every bit as good as its older brothers - the PC 11 and PC12. For this reason, it also scores an 8.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
