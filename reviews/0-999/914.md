**The Schtick:** Elijah Craig Barrel Proof is a 12 year old, cask strength, release from Heaven Hill in Kentucky. Batches were originally denoted by proof alone, but in recent times, since the bottle re-design, batches now get additional designation to help with tracking releases.

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 65.5% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Honey, tobacco, bold oak. Faint fruitiness, rich vanilla cream, pepper and ethanol. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel with very present heat. Honey, oak, caramel, faint cherry, pepper, light tobacco. Very hot. 

**Finish:** Long finish but very hot. Rich caramel, honey, vanilla. Some oak, light fruit character, a bit of pepper. 

**Overall:** Again, good, but I cant help but think these newer batches are hotter and lighter with less oak and cocoa presence. The searing heat is tough to get through some times. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
