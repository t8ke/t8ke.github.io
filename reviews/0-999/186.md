[**Review #186 | Bourbon Review #103 - Very Old Barton Bottled in Bond (1990)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-186-very-old-barton-bottled-in-bond-1990/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Barton

**Bottler:** Barton

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Fruity, malty and sweet. Dash of faint fudge, confectioners sugar and thick vanilla and icing. 

**Taste:** Syrupy sweet and a good mouth feel. Not hot for the proof. Vanilla, dusty leather, fruity malty doughy sweet. Clove and cinnamon. Yum.     

**Finish:** Medium finish - sweet and fruity with no heat to speak of. Well rounded overall and enjoyably complex.   

**Overall:** VOB really doesnt get broadcasted too much as a legendary dram but both of the BIBs from them Ive had (this one and the new one) are really something to talk about. Its delicious, aged at least 4 years, good proof and an insane value. Im not sure which one I favor more in the old vs new debate (I wish I had a way to SBS them) but the new doesnt seem to have dipped in quality and theyre both delicious. For this, Im rating the dusty Very Old Barton Bottled in Bond a 6 - placing it among other "step above" drams like modern VOB BiB, Heaven Hill Bottled in Bond 6yr, Colonel EH Taylor Small Batch and Smooth Ambler Old Scout 10yr Bourbon. Impressive.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
