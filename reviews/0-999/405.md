**The Schtick:** This is another release of the annual circus that is Parkers Heritage Collection. This is a 24 year old bourbon that is bottled in bond and, as such, is released at 50% ABV. There was both a spring and fall bottling, and Ill admit, I do not recall which this is. I doubt it makes any real difference either way.

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 24 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Spicy, oaky and hugely fruity. Banana laffy taffy, vanilla, cocoa. Cherry chocolate cordials. This is really interesting so far.  

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, oaky, cocoa, pepper, spicy and very oaky. Overoaked for my tastes. Tannic and dry. No fruitiness here besides some traces of banana laffy taffy and cherry chocolate. 

**Finish:** Medium, tannic and dry. Pepper, beef jerky, faint cocoa. A bit hot, surprisingly.

**Overall:** Far too much oak. This is dry, thin (despite the age and proof) and generally not too exciting. Im really surprised because I expected a lot of really rich flavors and a much more velvety mouthfeel and I was pretty letdown. At the end of the day, age isnt everything. The nose and palate were interesting and unique, but really no better than a dram of Buffalo Trace, in my opinion.

Thanks for reading!
