**The Schtick:** This is a cask strength release of Redbreast distillate, which is a pot still Irish single malt product. 

-----

**Distiller:** Redbreast

**Bottler:** Redbreast

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 58.6% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years

**Nose:**  This might sound weird but bread. Sweet, yeasty, caramel-y bread notes. Theres some vanilla as well but not nearly as prominent as the bread notes. Pretty inviting.

**Taste:** Malty sweetness, some light floral fruit, some more caramel and vanilla but all subdued. For the proof its very welcoming and there isnt much ethanol bite.

**Finish:** Long, mildly hot but gentle overall. More honey and yeasty malt with some more light floral fruit on the way out. Kind of like spiced pears.

**Overall:** For a subset whisky I really havent tried a while lot of, this was a great re-introduction. Delicious, high proof and really just solid all around. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
