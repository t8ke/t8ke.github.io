**The Schtick:** This is a release from Edradour, who is owned by Sigantory Vintage. It is matured in Grand Arome rum casks (cant say Ive run into these before).

-----

**Distiller:** Edradour 

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Bredy, sweet. Loads of apples, and pears. Honey, lots of rich toffee. Some souring here, faintly lactic. Almost like cheese, if that isnt too out there. Orange peel, lemon bread. 

**Taste:** Think to medium mouth feel. No real heat. Vanilla, apples and pears. Mildly lactic and sour. Faintly chalky, lots of cream here with some brown sugar and pepper. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length, with faint pepper and sweet bread-y fruits. Lots of cream, honey and apples. 

**Overall:** Super bread-y and really, really unique. Not super remarkable, though, at least to my palate. The chalky, lactic, sour notes really degrade from what I was hoping to see from those casks. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
