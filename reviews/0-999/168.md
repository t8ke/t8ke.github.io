**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** AnCnoc

**Bottler:** AnCnoc

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years

**Nose:**  Honey and doughy sweetness. Theres some light sherry style notes: fig, plum and syrupy grapes. Light strawberry. Its like a light, fragrant, fruity arrangement in a small danish pastry. I enjoy it.    

**Taste:** Sweet but thin mouth feel. Theres a lot of sweetness here and its definitely a bit doughy also. Some thin vanilla icing. Summer fruits like grapes, strawberry and a tiny bit of raspberry. 

**Finish:** Its medium to short and a bit hotter than expected for such a low proof dram, but its not too hot or unreasonably so. Very sweet but not cloying. Its light and summery and goes down easy. 

**Overall:** I didnt know what to expect here - this is my first brush with AnCnocs take on whiskey but it reminded me of a little sweeter Glengoyne. Delicious and light, definitely on the more dessert end of things. I really enjoyed it though and it could easily be a daily, no frills type of dram to me if the price was right. I dont see it much here in the Midwest but I would easily snatch a bottle in the $45-$50 price range. Based on this tasting, theres no question that this dram meets the criteria to merit a 5 rating. Its solid, delicious and I dont see any real flaws with it. 

Thanks for reading!
