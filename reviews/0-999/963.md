**The Schtick:** This is a limited edition annual release from Bunnahabhain that spent 8 years in a refill sherry cask, and then was moved to a first fill PX cask for the remainder of its stay. It is bottled at cask strength, with no coloring or filtering.

**Distiller:** Bunnahabhain

**Bottler:** Bunnahabhain

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 54.3% ABV

**Age:** 14 Years

**Nose:**   Rich honey, sweet brown sugar, tobacco, pralines. Jammy fruits like currant, blackberry and almost some toffee.

**Taste:** Rich mouthfeel, sherry, maple, tobacco, sweet, spicy and rich. Brown sugar, molasses. Very sweet here, with a whole lot going on. Its definitely on the sweet side of the spectrum - not dosed, but it spent plenty of time in a very wet barrel. Tons of fruits like figs, currant, date fruits, blackberry. Rich and syrupy. 

**Finish:** Long. Very little heat despite the proof. Total brown sugar and fruit bomb. Thick sticky raisin bread, pudding. Brown sugar, molasses, toffee and caramel. Figs, dates, sticky berry.

**Overall:** Really, really enjoyable. On the sweet side, but this has become a favorite of mine as I worked through the bottle. I previously tried this via a blind pour, and bought a bottle. I wondered if I would be enamored by the end of a full bottle as I was at the end of a single pour, and I have to say, that is the case. Great work, Bunna.  

Thanks for reading!
