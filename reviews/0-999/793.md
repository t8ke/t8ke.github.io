**The Schtick:** This is an old selection from Ledaig (Tobermory) that was also the first ever r/scotch single cask selection. It is from Ledaig, which is peated distillate from the Tobermory distillery in Scotland. It was matured in a sherry cask, bottled at cask strength and is the final bottle from the lot. 

-----

**Distiller:** Tobermory

**Bottler:** Tobermory

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 59.2% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet, bready, sticky toffee. Salt, minerals, sweet fruitiness, rich sherry and cocoa.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, no heat. Sweet cream, super thick cherry syrup. Sherry fruits. Peat swoops in, it is a nice ashy, woody peat with a pretty significant smolder. Lots of pepper, tobacco,  stone fruits. 

**Finish:** Long, smoldering ash and wood smoke. Like breathing out a campfire. Sweet caramel abounds, as does rich stewed fruits. 

**Overall:** This is maddeningly delicious, and I wish I was around when this bottle first came to fruition around these parts. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
