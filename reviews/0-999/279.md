**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Aberlour

**Bottler:** Aberlour

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 59.7% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Fudge, cocoa, thick brown sugar, molasses. Dusty leather, plumbs, figs, raspberry jam, spicey clove and date fruit

**Taste:** For the proof theres surprisingly manageable heat, rich oloroso fruits and cocoa. Its like chocolate covered raspberries and strawberries, cherry fudge. Thick maple, molasses and some clove bite. Theres just few other words to use than "thick, fruity and fudgy"

**Finish:** Long, rich and complex. Shockingly tame heat. Sweet, fruity and very chocolate forward. Its delicious.

**Overall:** To me, this is the underrated dram of the century. This bottle goes for somewhere around $70 near me and that is just a bargain. Price aside, not factored in, this dram also knocks my socks off from a quality perspective. It can duke it out with young GlenDronach single casks and the flavor, profile and depth are all top notch. This will never not sit on my shelf since it checks so many boxes that I deeply love in a sherry bomb. And yes, this is a complete sherry bomb. Im giving this a Rank 7.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
