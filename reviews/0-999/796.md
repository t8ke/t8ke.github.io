[**Review #796 | Bourbon Review #437 - Westland Single Cask #118 Astors Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-796-westland-single-cask-118-astor-selection/)

**The Schtick:** This is a single cask of Westland spirit that is aged in Garryana oak.

-----

**Distiller:** Westland

**Bottler:** Westland

**Selection:** Astor

**ABV:** 55.8% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet vanilla, baking spices, pungent fruit, grassy, some wet cardboard, Splenda. 

**Taste:** Sweet confectioner sugar, think to medium mouth feel. West cardboard, grassy mint, floral and some heat. 

**Finish:** Long, growing sour, bitter and minty. Really flora, perfume-y, grass. That artificial sugar note is here in spades. 

**Overall:** Everything about this tastes strange, artificial and accentuates some of my biggest issues with Makers Mark 46 - my previously most Splenda-y bottle ever. Its amplified, and I cant, for the life of me, figure out why Westland is still using Garryana for anything but quick finishes. Yikes. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
