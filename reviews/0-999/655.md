**The Schtick:** This is a non-LE release of Bowman spirit, finished in port casks. Thanks to /u/deathsnuggle, from the Whiscord Discord server for this sample. Im not sure if this product sees distribution outside of Virginia, at least at this time.

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Pepper, cocoa and some oka. Tobacco, faint fruitiness. Some weird new make notes. Overall, its not bad, but a hair muted. 

**Taste:** Really apparent new make notes, which I find really weird. Corn syrup, wet cardboard. Theres faint cocoa and tobacco, without a lot of port character at all. 

**Finish:** Short and astringent. I think its just young. Corn, pepper and some faint fruitiness. Faint raspberry. 

**Overall:** Im really not impressed with this given what I was expecting but Im hoping to see some redemption in future releases with more maturation time. My hunch with this here is that it is young and spends a minimal time seeing any kind of port interaction at all. Hopefully both of those things can be addressed in future batches. I get that there would be some comparison with the past LE that was also port finished, but this just isnt great as it stands right now. 

Thanks for reading!
