**The Schtick:** Four Roses Private Selects are some of the best quality and value in bourbon today. This is an OESK pick from Chucks retailer and is just a hair under 10 years old.  

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** Chicks

**ABV:** 56.1% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet cream, caramel. Its nutty and sweet with lots of vanilla, floral notes and a heavy butterscotch presence. Theres faint cocoa notes but this leans squarely in the the sweet and caramelly/toffee/butterscotchy notes park. 

**Taste:**  Rich mouthfeel, medium thickness. Sweet caramel, sweet vanilla and a whole lot of butterscotch. Theres some light oakiness, to pair with toffee, cocoa and some nice floral notes also. 

**Finish:** Long and sweet with surprisingly tame heat. Complex and sweet, the finish is nice and buttery. Lots of floral sweets here. 

**Overall:** This is a good pick, and I really enjoyed it. I love the OESK profile and this will score highly. I enjoyed how much flavor there was and the sweet direction it took. The finish is really what sold me though after a really nice palate. This cant top my favorite OESK to date, but its made an admirable display.

Thanks for reading!
