[**Review #66 | Bourbon Review #36 - Smooth Ambler Old Scout 8yr Single Barrel Bourbon**]( https://t8ke.review/review-66-smooth-ambler-old-scout-cask-strength-single-barrel-bourbon-8yr/)

**The Schtick:** This is a single barrel release from Smooth Ambler. Bottled at cask strength from sourced MGP distillate. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Smooth Ambler

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 53.5% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  A good bit of ethanol. Some vanilla, allspice and molasses under that alcohol nose. 

**Taste:** Oak, some mild char, vanilla and more ethanol. The 8yr Rye was stronger proof wise and let almost none of its alcohol show through relative to this. 

**Finish:** Long and hot. More wood and molasses. 

**Overall:** This was mediocre. Not bad, but very heavy ethanol covered most of the good notes here. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
