[**Review #96 | World Review #7 - Tullamore Dew**]( https://t8ke.review/review-96-tullamore-dew/)

**The Schtick:** This is a triple pot distilled product from Tullamore in Ireland. 

-----

**Distiller:** Tullamore Dew

**Bottler:** Tullamore Dew

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey. Sweet confectioners sugar.  

**Taste:** Thin. Tastes like honey and cardboard. Is there even alcohol in this? 

**Finish:** Short because there is none. Left with some dust and musty paper, mild honey and the vow to "never ever repeat this night again."

**Overall:** All in all: underwhelming. The ABV is as low as allowably possible and the taste is likewise vacant. Not much more to say. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
