[**Review #106 | Rye Review #60 - High West Rendezvous Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-106-high-west-rendezvous-rye/)

**The Schtick:** This is the flagship rye offering from High West. It is a blend of Barton and MGP rye that is aged and bottled at High West in Park City, Utah. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** High West

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Brown sugar, massive molasses and vanilla. Almost some buttercream to accompany the rye spice. 

**Taste:** Theres sweet rye spice followed by some brown sugar and woody leather. Molasses and maple roll in next. Very well blended and nicely complex. The mouthfeel is thicker than I expected on this one and I like it a lot. 

**Finish:** Medium long, sweet and once again complex. At 92 proof it leaves you wondering if theres really alcohol content at all. Id love to try a ramped up, CS offering from High West if they ever make one but I dont think the rye is suffering at the proof its at. 

**Overall:** Great, solid offering from High West. A good rye at a good age. 

Thanks for reading!
