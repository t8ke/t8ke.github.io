**The Schtick:** This is a 10yr release from Glenrothes. It is a single barrel bottled specially for Abbey Whiskey. It is matured in a sherry cask. 

-----

**Distiller:** Glenrothes

**Bottler:** Glenrothes

**Selection:** Abbey Whiskey

**ABV:** 67.1% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, melon, cake icing. Faint fruitiness, super sweet so far. Nutty rich sherry, really honey forward. Its all sweet, really vanilla heavy, etc. No real ethanol presence, which is surprising given the proof which is, quite frankly, a monster. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich mouth feel. Some mild heat, but really restrained which is impressive. Honey and melon are the first two dominant things that I taste. Some subtle nutty sherry profile steps forward and a load of rich toffee accompanies it. Its not a sherry bomb, Im guessing this is a refill cask, but it does very nicely. Unbelievably rich. 

**Finish:** Medium length, still mild on the heat but the finish doesnt last as long as I would expect. Its loaded with floral sweetness, some balancing pepper and a sweet honey vanilla departure. 

**Overall:** This is super interesting. Its different, the nose is phenomenal, the proof is unexpected but well executed. I really enjoyed this as well. Really goes to show that the magic in Glenrothes is completely present once you step outside their unremarkable core line. 

Thanks for reading!
