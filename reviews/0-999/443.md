**The Schtick:** This is the final phase of Gobble Til You Wobble and Ill be looking at both the Bourbon and Ryes that are sold under that line. Bourbons first, ryes second. This is a modern offering from Wild Turkey with the higher entry proof. It is diluted to 110 pf and sold as a single barrel offering across the nation. Many stores have been able to do picks of these products, and extra information is available as a result. It is, still, a NAS product, though.

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** C+S Straight Up

**ABV:**  55% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet caramel, citrus zest, vanilla. This one is sweet, a hint of fruity, but very dessert note forward. Im looking forward to this, since I have a sweet tooth.   

**Taste:**  Medium mouthfeel, no brash heat, initially. Spicy clove, cinnamon and some astringency pop up though and then it feels hot hot hot. Theres a good deal of toffee and cocoa here. Overall, though, it leans towards the spicy here. Which was interesting, given the nose. 

**Finish:** Medium length, and the heat is gone again. Weird. Lots of cocoa here, clove, cinnamon, dry oaky tannins and then a really sweet vanilla note to leave on.  

**Overall:**  This is a little spicier than Im accustomed to liking. There are picks Ive liked better, and I cant get over the rollercoaster this took me on. The palate was surprisingly hot, but, by the finish it was all gone. Completely gone. What a wild ride. Still delicious, though, and none of these have failed to disappoint yet. 

Thanks for reading!
