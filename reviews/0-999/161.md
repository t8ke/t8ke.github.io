[**Review #161 | Scotch Review #64 - Highland Park 18**]( https://t8ke.review/review-161-highland-park-18yr/)

**The Schtick:** This is an 18 year old release from Highland Park.

-----

**Distiller:** Highland Park

**Bottler:** Highland Park

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 18 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet cream and brown sugar with a good dash of grapes and some darker fruit like date fruit. Theres a faint hint of smoke that lingers and blends quite nicely. 

**Taste:** Sweet cream and custard. Disappointingly thin mouth feel but its easygoing due to the proof. Lots more grape here with a bit of strawberry jam. The smoke really charges in though and makes a strong showing. Not in a Ardbeg/Laphroaig/Laga kind of way, but a simple campfire and ash smoke that just is. It doesnt dominate or cover up and of the sweets and fruits. I quite like how well it balances and I think this is a strong showing on Highland Parks part - its complex and all of the players are in it for the team. Nothing is clobbering another flavor to be the top dog. 

**Finish:**  Medium and smokier than the palate. Its not hot and the cream and fruits reappear to gently guide it out to sea. 

**Overall:** I like it a good deal. It might have broached closer to an 8 for me if the mouth feel wasnt so thin and the proof was a bit higher, but with all of that in stride - Id take another glass again. I havent tried the 15 before, nor any of the special or LE offerings but the 18 has really focused my opinion back on Highland Park.

Thanks for reading!
