**The Schtick:** This is a cheeky NDP who uses their brand to indicate the states involved in producing and bottling their sourced spirits - the O, K and I are stand-ins for Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana. According to them, it is distilled in Indiana, bottled in Kentucky, and loved in Ohio. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** New Riff Distillery

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 48.9% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Very prominent corn. Vanilla, caramel, clove and cinnamon. Lots of tobacco. On the drier, spicier side of things.   

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. A good bit of heat, hot for the proof. Fruity, faint passion fruit. Pepper, vanilla, clove, oak, tobacco, earthy. Bitter. 

**Finish:** Short, but prickly hot. Peppery, dry. Lots of clove and tobacco. 

**Overall:** For a 10 year old, this is drier, oakier, and much hotter than it should be. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
