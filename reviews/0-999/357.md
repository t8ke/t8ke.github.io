**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Bowmore

**Bottler:** Bowmore

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.8% ABV

**Age:** 23 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet honey, jammy berries, toffee, mild peaty notes. Sweet, jammy sweetness with an undertone of peat. Smells delicious.

**Taste:** Nice mouthfeel, sweet, jammy with an impressive balance of sweet and peat. Mildly ashy, nice raspberry and cherry port notes. The heat is very much in check here. Its sweet, balanced and fruity with due restraint. Hint of brine, but its faint.

**Finish:** Medium in length. The heat is in check here also. I wish it went on a hair longer but im not at all disappointed.

**Overall:** I generally do not like Bowmore. Nothing Ive had from them so far has left me with any kind of positive takeaway. This though, is a different story. I think the finishing integrated well with the base spirit here and made something unique and very good. Im not sure how much it costs, but I think this is the first Bowmore Ive really enjoyed through and through. Im giving this a Rank 7. Yum. Thanks Flavaflav!

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
