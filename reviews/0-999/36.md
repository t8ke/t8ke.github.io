[**Review #36 | Scotch Review #14 - Lagavulin 12**]( https://t8ke.review/review-36-lagavulin-12yr/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 12yr old, cask strength, bottling from Lagavulin. 

-----

**Distiller:** Lagavulin

**Bottler:** Lagavulin

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 55.1% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Whew. Smoke, peat, acetone, some bandage funk but nothing like Ardbeg. Theres a little vanilla, citrus and sherry sweetness. I like this a lot.

**Taste:** Theres a lot more sweetness and a lot less smoke and peat. A couple drops of water really bring out the sherry and the cream which now balance the smoke very well. I like it, and a drop or two of water really helps tame the proof as well since 110pf here tastes a lot rougher than a good deal of the higher proof bourbons I own.      

**Finish:** Its long and surprisingly less vicious than I expected. Less peat here and a very pleasant amount of smoke.     

**Overall:** This is really a very impressive bottle. If only it werent so hard to find / expensive. This really shows how good a peated dram can be and the blending is very well done.  

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
