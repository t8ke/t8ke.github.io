[**Review #159 | Scotch Review #63 - Springbank 14yr CS Fino Sherry**]( https://t8ke.review/review-159-springbank-14yr-cask-strength-fino-sherry/)

**The Schtick:** This is a limited Springbank release that is bottled at cask strength and matured in Fino sherry casks. 

-----

**Distiller:** Springbank

**Bottler:** Springbank

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 56.3% ABV

**Age:** 14 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Char with fortified sweetness. Wine fruitiness, strawberry, cherry, grapes and plums. Lots of vanilla and custard and a good deal of woody sweetness. 

**Taste:** This is absurd. Wine, char and smoke. All three are perfectly balanced. The wine and fruitiness are delectable but not too sweet. The smoke is lightly salty and vegetal with a good charred punch. This is what I imagine a cigar on the deck with a good vintage would taste like. 

**Finish:**  Long, and far less hot than one would expect for the proof. Its dangerously drinkable and fully enjoyable. Theres a good deal of smoke here too, mostly ashy char, but the wine just sings. Thick and rich, the custard, cream and dark fig and plum coupled with the bright raspberry and strawberry are just fantastic. 

**Overall:** This is delicious. I enjoy smokey drams but they almost always fall behind sherry finished ones in my personal tastes. This really redefines that line. The combination and balance of the finished sweetness, the fruit and the char and smoke is just mind blowing to me. Wish I could still find a bottle around because this would be worth it 10/10 times.  

Thanks for reading!
