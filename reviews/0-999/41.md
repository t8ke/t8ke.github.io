[**Review #41 | Bourbon Review #22 - Bookers 2014-06 (Unnamed)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-41-bookers-2014-06-unnamed/)

**The Schtick:** Bookers is a Beam/Suntory product that is released unfiltered and at casks strength.

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 63.85% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Theres more sugar notes, mainly brown sugar and molasses and a bit less pepper and wood. 

**Taste:** Sweeter and a more buttery profile. I really like this, and while it feels a bit hotter, its still very delicious. Lots of sweetness and vanilla + maple. Theres a bit less peppery wood and the alcohol bite seems better blended despite the (minute) increase in proof. 

**Finish:** Longer and much hotter. This surprised me based on the mouth feel but this still wouldnt deter me from picking up this dram frequently.

**Overall:** Still a great bottle. The profile is very consistent. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
