**The Schtick:** As the name may suggest, this is a cask strength wheated whiskey from Dry Fly in Washington. 

-----

**Distiller:** Dry Fly Distilling

**Bottler:** Dry Fly Distilling

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 3 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet honey, caramel, mall food court Cinnabon, faint toffee. Overall, all sweet. Not a bad thing.

**Taste:** Thick and rich with some heat present. Caramel and toffee are prominent with some very welcome oak in the background. Really rich caramel throughout without the peppery redhots that I get in lots of other wheated whiskeys. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and very tame for the proof. Delicious caramel, cocoa, toffee profile here also. 

**Overall:** Hot damn this is impressive and delicious. Complex, nice profile and not punishing. Well done, Dry Fly.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
