[**Review #208 | Bourbon Review #117 - Colonel E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof **]( https://t8ke.review/review-208-colonel-eh-taylor-barrel-proof-1275/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 63.75% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Maple and nutmeg with a whole lot of sweet brown sugar

**Taste:** Sweet and syrupy - corn syrup notes blended with maple syrup. Heavy on molasses, nutmeg and clove. 

**Finish:**  Long and sweet with not as much heat as the proof would suggest. This is a very sweey corn/brown sugar forward finish and I actually like it a good deal. 

**Overall:** Overall, I enjoy this batch. I havent been a huge follower of the Barrel Proof but every time I taste and review it, Im pleasantly surprised. I always wonder why I let it fly under my radar. And then I realize that its going for $80 around me and thats a bit absurd. At $80 theres a ton of delicious scotch to be bought but all the same this dram is delicious and deserves the rating I give it. Sure, I wont go hunt and buy bottles but every sample I have leaves me a happy camper and my taste buds would agree. For these reasons, Im rating the dram a 7 - CEHT Barrel Proof 127.5pf is a solid and delicious barrel proofer despite its elevated price. 

Thanks for reading!
