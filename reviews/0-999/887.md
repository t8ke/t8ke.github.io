**Nose:**  Vanilla, sour fruits, sweet wine, caramel and icing. Light yeast quality. Faint oak, but not super bold. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Sweet vanilla, caramels, raisin bread. Fresh baked doughnuts: yeasty and sweet. Nice wine presence, though it is muted. Light, syrupy fruits. Mild jammy quality. Real dirty wine influence. Lots of earth. 

**Finish:** Medium length, no real heat. Some bitter wood, faint sulfur. Vanilla, sweet wine, some caramels. 

**Overall:** This was a really interesting bottle. I was hoping for something super jammy, but theres so much more going on here. Its a really "dirty" profile - earthy, wine-y, bread-y with some sweet notes in there also. I really enjoyed working through a bottle, but I dont think I need another. 

Thanks for reading!
