**Distiller:** Aultmore

**Bottler:** SMWS

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 57.4% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years

**Nose:**   Tar, vanilla, buttered popcorn, caramel, faintly nutty, melon, strawberry, cream, faint salt. Im really enjoying the complexity of the nose here. 

**Taste:** Caramel, buttered popcorn, toffee. Theres some mild heat, apple pie, vanilla This pairs nicely with some faint smoke, plastic, coffee. Strange arrangement of notes here, its weird, but its sort of working. Sweet, smokey, savory. Theres a little of all three. 

**Finish:** Long, hot, sweet and savory. Toffee, vanilla, plastic burning. I like whats going on here but the heat is a bit much. 

**Overall:** This was pretty nice, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was certainly different and diverse, and the SMWS keeps their track record in good shape with another good barrel selection. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
