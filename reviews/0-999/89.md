**The Schtick:** This is a store pick from Smooth Amblers Single Barrel program. This pick is from Davidsons in Colorado. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Smooth Ambler

**Selection:** Davidsons

**ABV:**  58% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Cinnamon, vanilla, some clove and monster molasses. This smells what Id want a bourbon maple pancake spread to smell like. 

**Taste:** Clove, cinnamon, some leather and wood spice. Theres less vanilla and molasses here than in the nose but its very well balanced.

**Finish:** Short to medium - not as long as I expected but not overtly disappointing. The finish is thick and layered with all sorts of bourbon flavors and this makes up for its duration. Its hot, but the vanilla really springs back here.

**Overall:** A good, solid bourbon and a nice pick from Davidsons.  

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
