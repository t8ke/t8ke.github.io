[**Review #111 | Rye Review #62 - Smooth Ambler Old Scout 7yr Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-111-smooth-ambler-old-scout-7yr-rye/)

**The Schtick:** This is a sourced rye from MGP, bottled by Smooth Ambler. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Smooth Ambler

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 49.5% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Dill, spearmint, clove, cinnamon, molasses and a solid portion of spicy vanilla rye notes. 

**Taste:** I dont know if there is a lot of bottle variation here or if it just needed to open up more but this was a spearmint bomb to me. Theres all of the usual suspects when it comes to rye - spicy leather and dust, sweet vanilla and savory maple but with those comes a dill hammer. I dont notice it in every sample but the MGP dill mint is really evident here. Not to say that it detracts from the quality - I rather enjoy it, but its not subtle about making itself known. 

**Finish:** Long and spicy, just like a good rye should be. Lots of dill but also tons of brown sugar. Its delicious.

**Overall:** 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
