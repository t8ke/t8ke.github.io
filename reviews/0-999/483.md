[**Review #483 | Rum Review #11 - Hampden 18yr Rum (Kill Devil)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-483-hampden-18yr-kill-devil/)

**The Schtick:** This is an 18yr expression released by Kill Devil of Hampden rum. My previously highest rated rum is a 24yr Golden Devil (KL) Hampden. Can this compare?

-----

**Distiller:** Hampden

**Bottler:** Kill Devil

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 18 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Really full nose, rich sweet and funky. Meaty bbq ribs, overripe, rotting fruit. Caramel, vanilla, some toasted coconut. Really big and funky.  

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, no real heat. Sweet, some ginger and rotting fruit. Rich and meaty with some white pepper also. 

**Finish:** Short, some astringency. There isnt really much here which is disappointing. Usually, a great Hampden marker is how long is lingers. This one dries up and is on its way fairly quickly. 

**Overall:** This was a good dram. It was several steps shy of phenomenal, though. The nose and palate were really pretty good but the finish was sort of a buzzkill. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
