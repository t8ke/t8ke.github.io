**The Schtick:** This is a sourced bourbon that is finished in rum casks, released under the Barrell line. This is sourced from an undisclosed Tennessee distiller and is barreled at cask strength.  This was sent to me as a blind sample. I reviewed it live on the official Whiskey Network Discord server and got the reveal so that I could type up this review. 

-----

**Distiller:** Dickel

**Bottler:** Barrell

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 61.25% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Muted, ethanol, caramel, overripe mango, citrus, faint molasses. Smells rummy but could also be a weirdly floral bourbon. Not rye, not scotch.   

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel but hot! Pretty hefty heat. Sweet though and features prominent caramel, toffee and pepper. Dose of ripe fruits, oak, tobacco, musty banana, papaya, mango, rubber. 

**Finish:** Long, rich but also hot. Rummy and loaded with honey, vanilla, mild funky heat, toffee and rubber. 

**Overall:** 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
