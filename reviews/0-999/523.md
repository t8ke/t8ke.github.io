**The Schtick:** This is a hyped Four Roses release commemorating Al Youngs 50 years as brand ambassador for Four Roses. It is a blend of 5% 23yr OBSV, 25% 15yr OBSK, 50% 13yr OESV and 20% 12yr OBSF. 

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 54.46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, clove, doughy and loaded with pepper. All spice and sweet floral fruitiness is here also.

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, caramel and honey are very prominent. Spicy and peppery, lots of clove and growing oaky and tannic. 

**Finish:** Medium length, spicy and dry. Lots of pepper, faint allspice, some caramel and toffee. 

**Overall:** I like this but couldnt help but feel let down. This was oakier, drier and more peppery than I would have liked, especially for such a "big" release. There are a host of private select bottled Id have taken over this in a heart beat. 

Thanks for reading!
