[**Review #707 | Bourbon Review #399 - Ancient Ancient Age**]( https://t8ke.review/review-707-buffalo-traces-ancient-ancient-age-10-star/)

**The Schtick:** This is a mashbill #2 product from Buffalo Trace. It is on their lower tier of product offerings, as can be spectacled from the plastic handle presentation they choose to bottle it in. This originally started as a 10yr product, then became "10 Stars" because ambiguity in this industry is often met with out cry and strict regulation. Wait a second. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Earthy, caramel, beet, pepper, tobacco.  

**Taste:** Sweet but not super rich. Thin medium mouthfeel. Young corn, cocoa, earthy tobacco, vanilla and some pepper. Faint wet cardboard of underaged spirit. 

**Finish:** Short to medium, but some heat. Young corn, vanilla, tobacco and coffee.

**Overall:** This is really not great, but also really not bad. I put it a peg under Buffalo Trace, but I get that Im one of the few who likely enjoy it. I think its probably the only bourbon I throw in a bourbon based cocktail because the only real cocktail I make is a lazy whiskey sour and this fits in just fine. Its not great bourbon though and deserves the 4/10 ima give it. 

Thanks for reading!
