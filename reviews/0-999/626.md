[**Review #626 | Bourbon Review #365 - Old Weller Antique Florida ABC Store Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-626-old-weller-antique-florida-abc-pick/)

**The Schtick:** This is a well proofed wheater released from Buffalo Trace. It is a NAS product using the wheated mashbill. Old Weller Antique used to be a common, easily available and affordable product, but has recently been struck by the halo effect generated by Buffalo Traces other, higher tier products. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** FL State

**ABV:** 53.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, caramel, red hot cinnamon candies and peppery allspice. Rich toffee and some creme brulee.

**Taste:** Medium thickness, some herbal spice, mild heat. Pepper, lots of cinnamon candies. The heat grows with time, as does the presence of some nice caramel. 

**Finish:** Long with some heat - lots of pepper and spice. Its nice, if a bit hot, but the cinnamon really diminishes with time. 

**Overall:** This is best described as a bowl full of Red Hots and Werthers caramels. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
