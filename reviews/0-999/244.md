**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Glendronach

**Bottler:** Glendronach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet, winey goodness. Thick syrupy port notes, mixed with vanilla and nougat. Theres slight clove, oak, cinnamon, some brown sugar but mostly, this is a wine fiesta. and I love it. 

**Taste:**   Sort of thin mouthfeel - I wish I could try this at cask strength. Sweet, port forward like no tomorrow. No heat. Its all toffee, port, some odd sweet funk and one more jammy fruit bash.

**Finish:**  Medium and gentle - no heat at all.  Sweet, although not as sweet as the palate and that nice underlying GlenDronach character gets to show a little here.

**Overall:**  Overall, this is damn delicious. Im not sure I could pay the $85-$100 that this goes for here in the states but its very tempting. I like the flavors, the balance, the heat and despite it being a bit thin, I can appreciate the mouthfeel given the proof its at. This at cask strength would be bonkers, I think. Im going to give this dram a 7 - I like it a whole lot. 

Thanks for reading!
