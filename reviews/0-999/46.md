**The Schtick:** Laphroaig is a Beam/Suntory scotch distillery in the Islay region of scotch. Known for several core age stated products, they also specialize in funky one-offs that make little sense and generally carry no age statements. This is a travel retail product and is not sold in the US.

**Distiller:** Laphroaig

**Bottler:** Laphroaig

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  48% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Plastic, but more sweetness. More smoke, but also some nice spice.  

**Taste:** More plastic at first than I expected but this actually gives way to some pleasant sweetness. Theres a whole lot of smoke, but its coupled well with some spicy sherry notes.   

**Finish:** A bit long, a bit tingly, but its not hot or rough and I find I enjoy it a little bit. Well rounded with some vanilla and one last kick of rubber on the way out. Theres some nice raisin here and a good bit of salted caramel but the peat is still very prominent. 

**Overall:** This is interesting in that the peat and sherry play well. PX is very syrupy and can often cover the characteristics of the base spirit. That is not the case here. 

Thanks for reading!
