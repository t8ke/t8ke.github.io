**Bottler:** Crown Royal

**Nose:**  I expected spice. I did not get spice. Its sweet and fruity, like banana laffy taffy, with a hint of pear as well. A brief confectioners sugar note. From what Im smelling, this is sizing up to be a basket of sweets. 

**Taste:** Very thin on the mouth feel but pleasant. Theres a surprising lack of sweetness although the banana and pear are still present. Theres a tiny bit of rye spice but nothing like the punch to the mouth that a High West rye embodies.  

**Finish:** A bit on the short side and a little note of astringency but not too rough. The bananas are still there and they follow through all of the way to the end with a little wood and pepper, but its very faint.   

**Overall:** This isnt a terrible product. Do I think its best in the world? Not really. Is it worst in the world? Certainly not.   

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
