**The Schtick:** This is a Mashbill #2 release from Buffalo Trace that is international only. It is bottled at cask strength.

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 62.8% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Heavy on the honey and cinnamon. Peanut brittle. Toffee, oak. Whoah, is this a KC SIB? Sure smells like it. 

**Taste:** Corn, vanilla and some oaky toffee. Earthy and peppery. Really thick and rich mouth feel, but the heat is there. It is hot.

**Finish:** Medium length, rich toffee, hot but not punishing

**Overall:** This was hot, but I really enjoyed it compared to previous SFTB. It was more oaky, toffee forward and rich on sweetness, even though the heat was there. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
