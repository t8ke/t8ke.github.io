[**Review #148 | Rye Review #83 - Thomas H. Handy Sazerac Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-148-thomas-h-handy-rye-2012/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 6 year old, cask strength rye released as part of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection each Fall. Proof varies with vintage. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 61.2% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Theres a ton of maple and metallic borwn sugar here. Thick rye kick, some oak and pine and more peppery, buttery sugar. It smells sweet, the ethanol is fairly well behaved despite a mild astringent tang. Mmmm.

**Taste:** Theres some definite heat here and I think thats due to only 6 years in the barrel. Its not too hot, but you can tell this is a heavy hitter. Theres lots of buttery rye spice and a delicious hint of maple and molasses. Theres a nice strong dose of pepper and layers of what seem to be clove and oak that diminish with time. The mouth feel is very good, I like it a lot and it is satisfying. Thick.

**Finish:** Long and sweet but growing a little hotter. Its thick to chew through but sticks with me for a long time. Here is where more rye characteristics raise their heads - lots more spice and pepper. It grows less sweet with time and drier and spicier. I really enjoy this transition and it makes sense since this mashbill is likely barely legal rye. 

**Overall:** Its exceptional. Its not a daily rye, and thats fine, but it is very good despite a little rougher finish. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
