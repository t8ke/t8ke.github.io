**The Schtick:**

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Compass Box

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Sweet cream, doughy lemon drop desserts, doughy, yeasty, sweet and fruity. Its like a bakery committed to producing only lemon bars. Thats not a bad thing.

**Taste:** Rich mouthfeel for the proof. Sweet and heavy on vanilla and clove. Its like a spice cake. Clove, cinnamon, citrus fruits and a bit of raspberry. Its a dessert dram for sure. Some apple pie notes. Really interesting, and delicious.

**Finish:** Medium in length, some drying astringency but then the fruity dessert notes are back. This is dangerously drinkable at 46% and like dessert...I want it all day long.

**Overall:** I really didnt know what to expect from this given that IB macallan is so hard to get your paws on but I ended up really liking this blend. Whatever sherry influence that exists is mild and a nuance - which I like. All of the focus is on the desserty bakery notes that showcase fruit and sweet and spice balance. I think this excels at that. Its a completely different profile from 3yr Deluxe, which I dont mind.

Thanks for reading!
