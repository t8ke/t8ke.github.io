**The Schtick:** "We met our first producer for our Vino De Mezcal series, Fernando Caballero Cruz five or six years ago at the annual Dia de los Magueyeros. He and his family live in the Mixteca Alta region. The trip in to Teozacoalco is about 5 hours on the worst rock and dirt road we have ever been on. The maguey Papalometl is named in Nahuatl for the butterfly (papalotl), Scientific name: agave Cupreata and looks like a giant Tobala. Distillation takes place in a stainless pot with a clay condensor and Carrizo (Mexican bamboo) tube. Earthy, dark and delicious. The nose is like sinking into a rich leather chair. A palate of leather, slate, a hint of black olive and meatiness. A medium long finish starting with slightly sweet notes of dark dried black cherries that gives way to an earthy, savory mushroom. Enjoy!" - Del Maguey Website
