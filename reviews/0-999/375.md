-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet corn, toffee, butter. Mild ethanol. Smells nice and sweet with very little astringency.

**Taste:** Surprisingly nice mouthfeel. Sweet corn, vanilla, caramel and a good bit of clove. Oakiness here is drying and tannic although much less so than others. Nice balance here. Sweet, savory, well balanced

**Finish:** Nice finish. Some heat but its long and rich. Not too much astringency.

**Overall:** I think this pick is pretty darn good. By pick, I mean single barrel, but the same rules still go. Theres definitely gobs of variation in all of these but I enjoyed this one quite a bit.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
