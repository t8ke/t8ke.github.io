[**Review #354 | Scotch Review #147 - Compass Boxs Oak Cross**]( https://t8ke.review/review-354-compass-box-oak-cross/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Compass Box

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Pear, apple, vanilla. Wazy fruits, mild oakiness. Reminds me very much of Great King Street artist blend.

**Taste:** Thin but fruity and delicate. Sweet with very heavy nods to apple, pear, some lemon zest, little to no heat.

**Finish:** Short, like a wisp.

**Overall:** I wanted to like this but it seemed like a delicate version of Great King Street. It was busy, but too much so. It was good but thin - not at all unpleasant but not really solid either. I feel like this was just over-engineered without a solid footing in what it needed to be. Rank 4.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
