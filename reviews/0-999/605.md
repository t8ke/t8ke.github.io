[**Review #605 | Scotch Review #201 - Mystery Review Compass Box 5th and Harrison**]( https://t8ke.review/review-605-compass-box-5th-and-harrison/)

**The Schtick:** This was a mystery sample sent to me by /u/ethanized. I tasted it, took notes, and then messaged him to reveal. I got a little caught up in trying to guess and forgot to think of a 1-10 score, so for these I decided to simplify things into one of five categories:

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Compass Box

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 55.3% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Thick, rich, sticky caramel. Some sherry, some stewed fruits but very nutty. Some peat, but not a peat bomb. Not a smoke monster.  

**Taste:** Thick mouthfeel, flavors are pretty rich. Lots of caramel, cocoa, toffee. Peat is present, more earthy than ashy or iodine-y. Some good minerality. There has to be some sherry influence in here also, but its not 100%. Guessing refill sherry and peated - likely in the 46% - 52% range. 

**Finish:** Long and complex. Lots of sherry and peat here - its leaning towards nutty and caramel though.

**Overall:** This dram is a moderately aged Tobermory, bottled between 9-15 years of age and partially matured in refill PX or Oloroso. This sample is bottled at 46% to 52% ABV. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
