**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Glendronach

**Bottler:** Glendronach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 52.8% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Thick fudge, fig, clove, sherry plums and deep, dark delicious things like cocoa, fudge, caramel. Theres some nice spice but much less than an olo matured dram. Just thick, rich and sweet. 

**Taste:** Thick mouth feel, coats well and for the proof is hardly noticeable in respect to ethanol. Creamy, fudgey sherry. Deep, rich wine fruits like figs and dates; plum and raspberry. This tastes like a fruit covered in dark chocolate and by neptune, its delicious.       

**Finish:** Long, intense sherry. Despite the cask strength, theres little to no heat. 100% sweet with a dash of spice and clove. The finish goes for miles and made me sit down and really exclaim "yeah". I want this, I want more of it and I want every one I can get my grubby little paws on.     

**Overall:** There is no doubt in my mind that this dram is a 9 for me. Its thick, rich and exceptionally well balanced. Its complex and powerful. This is the kind of sherry I love. No funk, heavy fudge, deep sweet fruits and a touch of spice. Its a good thing these arent on shelves around me because Id buy them all. Im not endorsed by GlenDro but I wish I was so I could taste this all of the time. The 12 was exceptional and this is no outlier - at 20yrs old it was an incredible dram to try and Im grateful. I intended to break up my sampling into two 1oz tastings but that just didnt happen. I couldnt be drawn away. And Im truly sad its gone. Sitting at the Rank 9 spot are few, champion drams. To give you an idea of this fine drams compatriots, the GlenDronach Single Cask 1995 20yr PX Puncheon sits beside Benrinnes 23, Bunnahabhain Signatory, Glenfarclas 1990 24yo and both other Single Casks Ive had: 12yr and 18yr. These single casks are divine and Im ecstatic Ive been able to taste a couple. Thanks for reading! 

Thanks for reading!
