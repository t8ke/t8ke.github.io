[**Review #438 | Armagnac Review #5 - Domaine du Cardinat 23yo Bas Armagnac**]( https://t8ke.review/review-438-domaine-de-cardinat-23yo-armagnac/)

**The Schtick:** Its old, its not expensive, and according to K&amp;L...it has pedigree. This is a Bas Armagnac that is bottled exclusively for K&amp;L. 

-----

**Distiller:** Domaine du Cardinat

**Bottler:** Domaine du Cardinat

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  47% ABV

**Age:** 23 Years

**Nose:**   Clove, baking spice and some nice nuttiness. I dont usually get that in spirits but its there. Some stewed fruits, namely plum, fig, raspberry, some concord grape, etc. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel but tame heat. Not too astringent. Some cocoa, lots of musty tobacco, lots of stewed fruits and a nice coffee toffee note. Some nice vanilla here also, but its nuanced.

**Finish:** Long and sweet. This is really nice on the way out - the stewed fruits give way to nice rich cocoa. 

**Overall:** Overall, I paid $59.99 for this and was pretty impressed. Its not amazing, or wildly complex, but it hits a lot of great notes without any big flaws. K&amp;L continues to impress with their selection of a wide variety of spirits and I plan to continue to try more.

Thanks for reading!
