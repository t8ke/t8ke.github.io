**The Schtick:** This is a Benriach single cask bottled for Astor Wines in NYS. It is 18 years old, bottled at cask strength with no filtration, coloration and port matured. 

-----

**Distiller:** Benriach

**Bottler:** Benriach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 55.5% ABV

**Age:** 18 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Rich stewed fruits, honey, cocoa and caramel. Nutty, nougat, strawberry preserve. Oak, tobacco, pepper. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich - a little heat. There is some oakiness here and some nice pepper to pair well with cocoa and caramel. Mild sulfur. Tons of really rich fruits, cherry, strawberry, fig and a faint wisp of smokiness. 

**Finish:** Long, dry and oaky. This blends well with lots of sweet fruits. 

**Overall:** I really enjoyed this but it did lean a hair on the oaky, dry and tannic end of things for me. This was a nice balance to keep it from being too cloyingly sweet with all of that sweet fruits but it was a touch heavy handed. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
