[**Review #500 | Bourbon Review #284 - Little Book Blended Whiskey**]( https://t8ke.review/review-500-little-book-blended-whiskey/)

**The Schtick:** Its a bird! Its a plane! Its an American start up craft whiskey product! Wait, no, its from Beam? Interesting. The name sounds iconically craft. Anyways, its a blend of different whiskeys of different mashbills, released under Freddie Noe. 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 60.27% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Caramel, vanilla, toffee. Faint young grain, new make. Mild ethanol, confectioners sugar. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, really mellow despite the proof. Caramel and toffee are big here, with lots of rich buttery vanilla and pepper. The new make note is here also, faintly in the background. 

**Finish:** Short, sweet, but the buttery sweetness persists. 

**Overall:** This is an interesting product. Its a polarizing product. I personally enjoy it, but the new make note is 100% worth noting. Its there. This has some real young components in it and they show. Id love to try this with just a couple more years of age on it. I think it could be really great. In a world where craft producers are usually the ones tinkering with experimentation (and usually the bad kind) I think its interesting to see Beam get on board with a release like this. I think it has potential. 

Thanks for reading!
