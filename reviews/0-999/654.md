[**Review #654 | Scotch Review #255 - Bunnahabhain Eirigh Na Greine**]( https://t8ke.review/review-654-bunnahabhain-eirigh-na-greine/)

**The Schtick:** This is a Bunnahabhain release originally released for those juicy Travel Retail markets but found itself distributed more widely with time. It means Morning Sky in Gaelic, but I prefer my own translations. Bunnahabhain Eirigh Na Gesundheit is partially matured in red wine casks.

-----

**Distiller:** Bunnahabhain

**Bottler:** Bunnahabhain

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 46.3% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet cream, heavy baked bread notes. Lots of sugary glaze, the wine maturation is really evident, even here. Lots of lightly jammy fruits in the nose. Overall, sweet and fruity with just a faint undertone of sea air.  

**Taste:** Medium thickness. No heat. Rich sherry and lots of vanilla. Caramel and toffee, salt and pepper, and a faint smoke character. Its a nice blend, with the sweetness and the wine cask influence taking the majority of the spotlight. 

**Finish:** Medium length, mild sulfur. No heat, really sweet with vanilla predominantly being featured. Some salinity and some raspberry as well.  

**Overall:** This was a really nice dram, if a little sweet. I think just a little heavier peat and wed be in business but I enjoyed this thoroughly. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
