[**Review #820 | Bourbon Review #444 - John J. Bowman Single Barrel Bourbon**]( https://t8ke.review/review-820-john-j-bowman-single-barrel-bourbon/)

**The Schtick:** This is a release from the Bowman line, which is Buffalo Trace distillate that is repeat distilled at the Bowman facility. This is a single barrel offering from them. I included this in the the Craft Whiskey Crackdown because most unassuming purchasers tend to think Bowman is its own special entity and, well, I wanted some brief relief before the next couple entries. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich, cocoa, caramel, oak, vanilla, cream, tobacco.

**Taste:** Medium, sweet clove, caramel, toffee, creamy, tobacco. For the healthy proof, the heat is very much restrained. The palate is nice and complex and delivers some notes I often dont find in Mashbill #1 or Mashbill #2 from Buffalo Trace. Really nice stuff here. 

**Finish:** Medium, complex, rich, caramel, vanilla, cocoa. Lots going on. 

**Overall:** Very nice. Complex and rich, well balanced. Im a fan - its well made and well proofed and has the age to back it up in the palate. I never see this around the Midwest, though, which is sort of a bummer but I guess thats Buffalo Trace distribution for ya. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
