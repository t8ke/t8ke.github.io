**The Schtick:** This is an especially old "dusty" release of Ezra Brooks bourbon. It is 12 years old and was bottled in 1968.

-----

**Distiller:** Ezra Brooks

**Bottler:** Ezra Brooks

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich honey, cherry syrup. Tobacco, earthy richness, caramel. Crazy cherry notes, no ethanol whatsoever. 

**Taste:** Thick, rich, no heat. Honey, almonds, amaretto, cherry syrup, caramel. Tobacco. Some faint earthiness. Overall, super rich. 

**Finish:** Long, rich, no heat. Vanilla, oak, pepper, tobacco. Rich cherry presence, almost like luxardo syrup. The richness is astounding. 

**Overall:** Incredibly solid and very enjoyable. Id take this over the vast majority of the other dusty things Ive had, save for maybe some of the older Old Fitzgeralds. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
