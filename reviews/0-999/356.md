[**Review #356 | Bourbon Review #356 - Buffalo Trace (Total Wine Select)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-356-buffalo-trace-total-wine-pick/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** Total Wine

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet vanilla, corn, some oak and clove. Very nicely balanced. Mild earthiness, maybe a hint of cocoa

**Taste:** Surprisingly no ethanol whatsoever. Sweet vanilla, mild cocoa, caramel, clove, faint oakiness. Nice mouthfeel for the proof

**Finish:** Medium, some of that mashbill #1 fruitiness coming in. Sweet, clove, caramel.

**Overall:** I think this pick beats the regular, off the shelf BT. Ethanol is very subdued and some of my favorite notes are ramped up a bit. Buffalo Trace is a great value, especially for what it brings to the table. For those that are new - Buffalo Trace scores my Median score, or a Rank 5, as a benchmark baseline to compare all others to in the bourbon landscape. I think this pick ramps up the caramel notes and a good deal of vanilla and faint cocoa that I like in the original so much. Therefore, Ill aware this a Rank 6.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
