**The Schtick:**  Wild Turkey 101 is a NAS offering bottled at 101proof. The mash is standard but barrel entry proof varies based on the era in which the barrels were laid down.

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sharp, astringent pepper. Clove, sweet maple. Oats??

**Taste:** Hot but sweet. The clove, cinnamon and pepper really pack a punch here. Lots more spice than Im used to on this one. Theres lots and lots of heat. 

**Finish:** Short and hot. Lots of clove, lots of caramel but also a good deal of heat. 

**Overall:** I wasnt wildly impressed with this one, but it seems to be a turkey outlier. Perhaps a turkey lost in the bushes. The heat was a bit more than I expected but it was consistent and stuck around. As a result, Im going to give this a 5. It just wasnt as balanced and nuanced as the rest. Still good, dont get me wrong, but not up to spec. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
