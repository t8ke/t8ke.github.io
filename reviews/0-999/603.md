[**Review #603 | Scotch Review #200 - The Macallan Classic Cut**]( https://t8ke.review/review-603-the-macallan-classic-cut/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 2017 Limited Release from The Macallan. It is bottled at cask strength. It seems the vast majority of the internet is comparing this to The Macallans previous Cask Strength. I will be reviewing this based on its own merits. 

-----

**Distiller:** Macallan

**Bottler:** Macallan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 58.4% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Sweet honey, syrupy vanilla. Toffee and caramel. Big, nutty, robust sherry. Faint pepper and sulfur. This is really rich on the sherry, leaning in the toffee + stewed fruits direction, rather than the spicy earthy cocoa oloroso way. 

**Taste:** Sweet honey, toffee and caramel. Thick mouthfeel, no heat. Dangerously drinkable. Rich stewed fruits - strawberries, melon, raspberry, really jammy. Sulfur and pepper are present but subdued, helping to balance the sweetness. Overall, this is big and bold, loaded with dessert sherry sweetness and balanced by spice and oak just right. 

**Finish:** Medium to long, rich sherry once again and then it becomes a toffee bomb. Faint heat, but very faint. 

**Overall:** This is phenomenal, I really enjoyed the entire bottle. Entirely too quickly, as a matter of fact. This is one Ill be staking out to replace, as soon as I can. Its just right for a sherry bomb, and priced similarly to ABunadh here, its a no brainer. 

Thanks for reading!
