**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Ancient Age

**Bottler:** Ancient Age

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Funky cornbread, sweet confectioners sugar. Pine and some light oak and ethanol. Butterscotch. 

**Taste:** "Sweet syrupy goodness". Direct quote from notes. Different than the nose - theres no hint of ethanol at all here. Sweet and buttery. This is great.   

**Finish:** Medium with no heat. Sweet and one dimensional but its the dimension I love. Confectioners sugar, faint peanut brittle and a lot of caramel.  

**Overall:** Well above average. For a dram I know absolutely nothing about, I was really very impressed. Its a BIB which many of you know I really love to dote on and the quality really shines. Its also cool that it is from 93. As far as rating goes, Im giving this a 7. Most BiB products are good but not exceptional. This one isnt exceptional either, but it is more than a cut above the rest. With a rating of 7, this guy sits in a loft bracket accompanied by the likes of Four Roses Single Barrel, SAOS 8/9yr Single Barrel Picks and Henry McKenna Single Barrel 10yr Bottled in Bond. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
