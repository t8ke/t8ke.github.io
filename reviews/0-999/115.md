[**Review #115 | Bourbon Review #64 - Bakers**]( https://t8ke.review/review-115-bakers-7yr/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 7yr Beam product released at 107pf. 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 53.5% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Cinnamon, leather and some weird oak funk. Not as much Beam peanut butter funk as I expected. 

**Taste:** Caramel and vanilla, theres a good deal of maple and oak as well. Some odd funkiness on the back of my tongue, almost vegetal but overall it drinks like a standard beam mashbill bourbon.

**Finish:** Medium to long, longer than expected. Lots of cinnamon and molasses here as well as that nice peanut brittle.

**Overall:** It seems that I go on and off on a daily basis on whether I love or hate this bottle. After sitting down with it for a while, its a good $35 bourbon. Not quite bookers but not every day is a Bookers day. Its not amazing but its not terrible either. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
