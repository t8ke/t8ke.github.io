**Nose:**  Sweet marshmallow, raisin bread, thick rich cocoa. Very stout-y on the nose. Vanilla, toffee, some faint toasted coconut. Faint cinnamon.   

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Coffee, toffee, raisin bread. Faintly musty. Almost faintly hoppy / hemp-y. Some heat. Vanilla, some marshmallow. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and rich. Honey, maple, vanilla. Lots of marshmallow, cocoa, raisin bread. 

**Overall:** This was super interesting. I wish wed see more releases like this, as it can do super interesting stuff in the profile. The nose is so BBA stout like it is insane. The palate is more brandy / whiskey and stout. The finish is almost all whiskey. Crazy interesting, crazy fun. 

Thanks for reading!
