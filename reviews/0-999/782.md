**The Schtick:** "Paranubes Rum is made by wild fermenting the fresh pressed juice of sugarcane grown without pesticide or fertilizer in the rich soil of master distiller Jose Luis Carreras farm. Distilled to proof with no additives, this rum - or aguardiente de cana as its known regionally, is exactly what you would find lost in the cloud forest of the Sierra Mazaeca mountains of Oaxaca, Mexico." - Paranubes Website

**Nose:**  Vinegar, tomatoes. Sour grapes. Ammonia. Super, super earthy. Funky and all over the place, but rich. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Pickled onions, vinegar. Sweet cream, mild heat. Faint rubber. Tomatoes, ammonia. 

**Finish:** Long, rich, acidic. Lots of sourness here and a vinegar-y acidic kick. 

**Overall:** This is weird. I bet it makes some mean cocktails. Its super complex and pretty well done, but Im not sure Id come around to it that often. 

Thanks for reading!
