**The Schtick:** This is a private cask of Arran spirit that was bottled by Arran for Specs in Texas. It is matured in a first fill sherry cask. 

-----

**Distiller:** Arran

**Bottler:** Arran

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 53.7% ABV

**Age:** 13 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sour fruits, dirty earthiness and wine. Sweet fake sugar, some oak and pepper. Sherry is super apparent, dominating the nose.  

**Taste:** Sweet caramel and cream. Oak and pepper, sour lactic fruits, mildly bitter. Medium mouth feel, a good bit of heat for the proof. Pepper, faint tobacco, more sour grapes.  

**Finish:** Short to medium in length, a bit of heat. Dirty, wine-y and earthy. Lots of pepper and tobacco, a plastic-y bitterness. 

**Overall:** Im sad to say that Im not a fan of this one at all really. Its disjointed, all over the place as well as hot and bitter. Next time, Arran. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
