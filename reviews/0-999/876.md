-----

**Distiller:** Daniel Bouju

**Bottler:** Daniel Bouju

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich cocoa, tobacco, pepper. Super jammy, figs, blackberry, currants, raspberries. Fudge. 

**Taste:** Thick, rich, ultimately super fruity. Caramel apples, raspberry jam, blackberries, currants, cranberry. Syrupy and sweet, with hefty oak bite, and a nice spicy backbone. Great structure, heat is very much in check given the proof. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and fruity with a strong oak backbone. Some molasses, brown sugar, jammy grape extract. 

**Overall:** Phenomenal, and gone too soon. I split this bottle locally with friends and immediately regret not having more on hand. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
