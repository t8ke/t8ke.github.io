[**Review #710 | Rum Review #21 - Plantation Overproof Rum**]( https://t8ke.review/review-710-plantation-overproof-rum/)

**The Schtick:** This is a massively potent release from Plantation, bottled at a bold 73% ABV. Do not confuse this with O.F.T.D, which is a newer release, and replaces this product in Plantations core line. This is a rum from Trinidad.

**Distiller:** Plantation

**Bottler:** Plantation

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  73% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Caramel, vanilla, meaty. Overripe, rotting fruit. Banna bread. Fruity and robust, but not super funky.

**Taste:** Thik, rich, hot. Understandably so. Cereal grains, fruity, overripe fruits. Guava, pineapple, earthy maple. Well rounded balance between fun, fruit and sweetness.

**Finish:** Long, some heat. Toffee, cereal, mplasses, fruity and floral.

**Overall:** This is undoubtedly meant to be a cocktail based product, but even neat, its delicious. While a bit hot, the flavor is robust and well balanced.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
