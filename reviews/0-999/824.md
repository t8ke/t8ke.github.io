[**Review #824 | Cognac Review #25 - Pierre Ferrand Reserve**]( https://t8ke.review/review-824-pierre-ferrand-reserve-cognac/)

**The Schtick:** "The Reserve bottling from Pierre Ferrand has an average age of 20 year old cognac. Their eaux-de-vie are aged in 270 liter Limousin oak barrels. As with all of their products, the grapes were sourced only from the Grande Champagne region, the highest or 1er cru. Ferrand distills its eaux-de-vie on the lees, a choice the brands can make or not. The lees (after fermentation, the wine is unfiltered and so retains the skins, stems, etc.) will capture and retain more aromas than distilling without them will impart." - Distiller.com
