[**Review #532 | World Review #15 - Kavalan Cask Strength Loch and Key Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-532-kavalan-cask-strength-loch-and-key/)

**The Schtick:** This is a cask strength store pick done by Julios / Loch and Key in MA. My swapper didnt really give me any deals past proof and name, but this really cant be anything but ex-bourbon. 

-----

**Distiller:** Kavalan

**Bottler:** Kavalan

**Selection:** Loch and Key

**ABV:** 57.8% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, apples, honey dew and melon. Confectioners sugar. Definitely ex-bourbon, if its wine finished at all, its incredibly light and sweet. Froot Loops. Massively prominent. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich and creamy, lots of fruit here too. Froot loops for days. Its so outrageously prominent here I cant ignore it. Lots of confectioners here too. Faint oak, some nice pepper. Its crazy sweet and fruity, with a hint of wood influence. No new make notes though which is huge. 

**Finish:** Long and hot with tons of apples and cream. 

**Overall:** Overall, I really liked this. This has probably been my favorite Kavalan to date and I think that ex-bourbon suits it the best. Coming from a wine finish obsessor this is sorta big. The froot loops here was undeniably strange but sort of delicious. I wanted to give this a 7 but the finish was just scary hot for the proof. This had potential though. Cant wait to try this again in a couple years. 

Thanks for reading!
