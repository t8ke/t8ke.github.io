**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** anCnoc

**Bottler:** anCnoc

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 24 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Sherry, leather, pepper, stewed fruits, cherry, raspberry strawberry cocoa

**Taste:** Bitter, oaky, spicy peppery. Sherry notes are there though. Sweet toffee, vanilla, stewed fruits, raspberry strawberry grapes and figs. Almost like jam.

**Finish:** Short, sort of hot, dry and drying. Almost oaky, peppery, tannic and bitter. 

**Overall:** This was oddly hot and tannic despite what 24 years in sherry should have done for a whiskey. Its not that I didnt expect there to be some wood characteristic but the sherry is present in the nose and palate and then dries right up for an overly bitter and dry finish.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
