[**Review #473 | Bourbon Review #473 - Bond and Lillard Whiskey Barons Batch 1**]( https://t8ke.review/review-473-bond-and-lillard-batch-1/)

**The Schtick:** Like Old Ripy, but different. Its been beat to death by now, for sure. This is batch 1 of the "Whiskey Barons" Bond and Lillard product. Charcoal filtered WT distillate, bottled at a respectable 50%. Its also bottled in 375 ml offerings but priced like expensive 750s. The word "Limited Edition" is also tossed around a fair bit, even though there are 100 of these on every shelf near me. Good ol, Campari.

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey      

**Bottler:** Campari

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Clove, caramel. Overripe banana, walnuts, and a "green" note. It smells very young to me, with some interesting notes I pick up in much younger, often craft, whiskeys.  

**Taste:** Thin with some heat. At 50% though, some heat is almost certainly present - although I was hoping for a little more richness. Sweet cocoa, cracked black pepper, some cloves. Not much sweetness from the nose is present here - its definitely spice heavy. 

**Finish:** Short, with some odd young funk, and a bit of heat. Peppery clove, allspice and faint sweetness are present. 

**Overall:** Overall, this is fairly disappointing. Enjoying this over the course of the bottle, not a lot changed. I hoped the youthful notes would go away, but they remained. I hoped some sweetness would develop to offset the heat and spice - that didnt happen. Its not terrible whiskey, but Id take 101 over this any day. Id also easily choose Buffalo Trace (my baseline) against this any day. Were in a day and age when whats in the bottle needs to stand up to other shelf competitors. Flashy packaging cant cover the flaws in this bottle, and the price it sits at is almost insulting. Campari, I know you can do better, even if you dont have to. I know this bottle basically sells itself thanks to your marketing giant, but you havent won over this guy. Stick to letting the Russells do what they do best - make great product.

Thanks for reading!
