[**Review #229 | Rye Review #129 - High West Rendezvous Rye Ex-Bourbon Barrel Finish**]( https://t8ke.review/review-229-high-west-rendezvous-rye-ex-bourbon/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** High West 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 52.4% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Maple, brown sugar, clove. Theres some nice honeyed vanilla. Little bit of dill. I like where this is going.

**Taste:** Dill surges in, then some clove, mint, vanilla and cream. There is a bit of molasses but not as much as their unfinished rye and Im living the complexity here between rye spice and "smoother" bourbon stereotypical characteristics.

**Finish:** Some heat but pleasantly warm. Lots more dill with some metallic minty notes coming forward. Lots more brown sugar here with the vanilla taking a backseat. Its kind of an evolutionary dram - not in the sense that its revolutionary or transcendent but that its changing all the time.

**Overall:** Im kind of a rye junkie and this one strikes a pleasant chord with me. The proof does great things to the body of the dram and the finish really helps round the runaway MGP dilliness into a nice, tame beast. It is undoubtedly still MGP rye though, dont get me wrong, but the finish makes it very pleasant and complex. Im giving this dram a spot in Rank 7 - same as regular Rendezvous Rye but its a unique take on it that I enjoy greatly. Theres some great horizontal growth here, which I imagine helps make High Wests rye more accessible palate wise to a greater audience.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
