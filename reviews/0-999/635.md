**The Schtick:** This is an 18 year old hogshead matured single malt from Allt-a-Bhainne distillery.

**Distiller:** Allt-A-Bhainne

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 18 Years

**Nose:**  Fresh grains, honey, toffee. Light citrus, some honey, faint pepper. Really light and sweet with some good fruity undertones.

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, vanilla buttercream, some melon and honey. Mild plastic note, faint smoke? Earthy pepper is subdued but present.

**Finish:** Long, delicately peppery and fruity. Almost like salted melon. Caramel and honey. 

**Overall:** This was super distinct and really delicious. I really enjoyed this and wish there was more of this distillerys products floating around. 

Thanks for reading!
