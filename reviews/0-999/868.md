[**Review #868 | Bourbon Review #460 - Virgin Bourbon 7yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-868-virgin-bourbon-7yr/)

**The Schtick:**  This is a little known brand from Heaven Hill sporting a reasonable age statement and more than reasonable proof. Its a part of the Crackdown here because I thought it was a craft / sourced release for a long time, until I dug into its origins. Sue me. 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.5% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, musty tobacco, caramel, oak. Not super complex, or remarkable, but also not heinous, either.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Notable oak presence, nice pepper, tobacco, caramel and some nougat. Theres some corn here, rich cream. Heat is very much in check. 

**Finish:** Medium length, gentle and rich with lots of clove, cocoa, cream and oak. 

**Overall:** This is pretty impressive for what it is. Given the price and the age, I assumed it was generated using refuse casks, but I was pretty impressed with this guy, all things considered.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
