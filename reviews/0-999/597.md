**The Schtick:** Knob Creek Single Barrels have long been a product easily available at most stores. In the last several years, picking private barrels of various ages has become more commonplace. Picks between 9 and 16 years of age have been popping up with great regularity and Ive taken it upon myself to try a variety and see how they fare. Some time ago, Knob Creek exhibited what may have been the largest barrel variation commonly agreed on in the bourbon community with some barrels ranging from wretched to godly. It has been my feeling that, as of late, the overall quality of these barrels being picked has risen, adding a slightly higher floor than existed before.

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** Cleveland Bourbon Club

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Big corn, lots of caramel and toffee. Theres almost some "green" notes to it - not quite new make, but it smells like a grassy pasture. Theres some faint oak, also. This is a really strange nose here. All over the place.   

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, no real heat. Sweet honey and toffee. Caramel peanut brittle bomb. Vanilla with some faint fruitiness. 

**Finish:** Medium length but lots of bitterness here. Lots of bitter oak. Astringent, almost some plasticy notes here. 

**Overall:** My little notebook says "all over the place" and thats really the best conclusion I have. The nose was really nice but funky and strange, the palate was good and the finish was just a bomb. Unfortunately, I just think this pick isnt for me. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
