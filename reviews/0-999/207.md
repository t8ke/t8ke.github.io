**Selection:** N/A

**Nose:**  Smells like pancakes on a Saturday morning. Loads of sweet syrup, maple and Aunt Jemima. Brown sugar, molasses, some faint cinnamon. Im trying to find words other than syrup descriptors but its hard.

**Taste:** Thick mouthfeel and warming. Delicious and sweet - still loads of maple and sugar. Apple and some all spice. Literally tastes like IHOP. Its really on the sweet side but I enjoy it. Feels like the quintessential dessert dram or even a good one for the dead of winter when you dont want a smoke overload. Its bold and rich.

**Finish:** Medium and warming but I wouldnt say hot. The proof is barely noticeable and it is as thick as the mouth feel. Turns to more of a cinnamon toast note.    

**Overall:** This is a niche dram and Im not ashamed to say that I love it. I really like the thick and sweet and it fills a void on my shelf very well. Its undeniable that this is a dessert pour but Ive really enjoyed it and Im sad to say Im finishing the bottle for this review. You will be missed, sweet syrupy rye. I wouldnt drink it every day but I really really enjoy it and it was a fun dram to go to when I was in the mood. For all of these reasons, Im giving this dram a 6. Its so very close to a 7 but a little more balance on the sweet vs other notes would have done this very well to bringing it up a hair to reach a more elevated rank. Thanks for reading!

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
