**The Schtick:** This is a cheeky NDP who uses their brand to indicate the states involved in producing and bottling their sourced spirits - the O, K and I are stand-ins for Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana. According to them, it is distilled in Indiana, bottled in Kentucky, and loved in Ohio.

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** New Riff

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 56.375% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Rich maple, honey, syrupy stewed fruits. Molasses and a good deal of vanilla butter cream. 

**Taste:** Thick mout hfeel. Some heat, but not punishing. Peppery clove, vanilla and molasses are prominent flavors. Theres a faint fruitiness, but it doesnt scream PX/Oloroso sherry. 

**Finish:** Medium length, some heat. Lots of pepper with some really weird herbal flavors rising. Its minty and loaded with spicy pepper and clove. 

**Overall:** This is very apparently high rye and was sort of a wild ride, but I dug it in the end. This is easily the best Ive tasted from them, as their other products were fine at best. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
