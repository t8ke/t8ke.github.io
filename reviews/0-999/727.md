**The Schtick:** "A real rarity this, a blended whisky produced entirely at one distillery: in this case the much-loved highlander Ben Nevis. Here the fine folk at Ben Nevis have blended malt and grain produced onsite as new make spirit, left together in one cask to mature for over 4 decades. Ben Nevis only produced both malt and grain whisky for a brief period in their history, between 1955 and 1981. This 43 year old dram is exquisite, balancing perfectly the old oak, malty depth and bright cereal grain flavours. At 44.5% ABV, this dram has retained its strength superbly, making for a flavoursome, rich and intense whisky." - FineDrams Website

**Distiller:** Ben Nevis

**Bottler:** Ben Nevis

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 44.5% ABV

**Age:** 43 Years

**Nose:**  Grassy, floral, hay, honey, vanilla.  

**Taste:** Fruity vanilla, light sweetness. Lots of hay, grassy floral character. Overall, not a ton going on here, which I find interesting. 

**Finish:** Medium length, doughy, sweet, lots of floral character and a whisp of toffee. 

**Overall:** Overall, this was interesting, in that it wasnt all that interesting. It wasnt bad, but for something this old, it lacked a lot of character beyond being grassy, floral and faintly sweet. 

Thanks for reading!
