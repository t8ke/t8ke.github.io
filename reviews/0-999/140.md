[**Review #140 | Bourbon Review #77 - Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (Batch 6)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-140-elijah-craig-barrel-proof-batch-6-re-review/)

**The Schtick:** This is a moderately elusive release from Elijah Craig, which is Heaven Hill distillate bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 70.1% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Jet fuel. Cherry. Root beer and cola. Oak and molasses with some very very mild char.  

**Taste:** Powerful. The proof is huge and so is the mouthfeel. Its rich and again, seems very much like syrup. Hot though and before the prickly heat kicks in there is a lot of cherry, molasses, cinnamon and a good deal more cola than the other previous batches. 

**Finish:** Goes for miles. Its large and powerful and Ill admit, this one was a bit tough to get through. Inhaling at the wrong moment is punishing but cut with a drop or two of water, this bottle sings.

**Overall:** Ive never seen such bold and massive flavor and this is becoming a very quick contender against the GTS crown. Wear a hazmat suit though, and maybe dont let this touch exposed skin. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
