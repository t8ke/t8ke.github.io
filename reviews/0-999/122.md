**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Glen Elgin

**Bottler:** Murray McDavid

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Hay, malty grain and a healthy dose of vanilla. Theres some nice sherry here, with dark fruits like fig, plumb, grapes and a thick fudge note drifting along. 

**Taste:** The mouth feel is a tad thin, but not too much so. Its sweet and fruity, with some nice mild brine notes. The salty pairs well with the sweet as more sherry develops, dates and figs really come out here. Delicious. 

**Finish:** Medium length, and surprisingly hot. Theres sweet and salty sherry and brine notes with some more malty grain and dough notes as well. 

**Overall:** Overall, theres more going on in this dram than I was expecting there to be. Its a nice balance of savory and sweet and makes for a solid, lighter dram. I tend to like sherry in just about anything and this dram benefits as well. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
