**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.6% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Spicy clove, oak, maple and some faint banana bread. Doughy, molasses and oddly creamy. Less oaky than expected due to the age but its still there in force.

**Taste:** Sweet and thick. Maple, clove, fruity cream. Very sweet, even with the wood influence. Little hot but surprisingly mellow for 130+ proof.

**Finish:** Long, complex. The heat grows, but not to unreasonable intensity. Very sweet, oaky and toffee forward.

**Overall:** This is a fantastic rye. Ill be straight, I like it a lot. Id drink it all of the time if I could. To me, I still think THH is the king of non-unicorn rye, because that profile just gets me going but this is a close contender. The mouthfeel is great and the flavors deliver well. I disagree with Murray on this being the best whiskey of 2016 but its certainly a good pick. If it was priced at $100 or below, and was actually accessible, Id pick up a bottle or two a year. But since the secondary has gone bonkers, Im also content to leave it to the freaks. Im rating this a Rank 8 - very good. On par, to some, with THH but I think this lags behind, just a hair.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
