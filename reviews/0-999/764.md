-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Barrell

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 66.4% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, heavy clove and spice. Waffle cone, vanilla. Faintly floral.  

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel but significant heat. It is hot. Spicy pepper, tobacco, vanilla and oak. 80% spicy, 20% sweet. 

**Finish:** Long, but very hot. Floral, minty. Orange zest, faintly chalky. Lots of spice and interesting floral notes. 

**Overall:** This was a dry, hot, spicy bourbon. I liked what notes were there but found the heat to be a bit overbearing. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
