**The Schtick:** This is a NAS, cask strength, Limited Edition release from Bowmore. It is a marriage of first fill PX and first fill Oloroso matured casks that are blended and bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Bowmore

**Bottler:** Bowmore

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 56.7% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, cocoa, rich stewed fruits. Faint earthy peat on the nose. Pepper, tobacco and nutty toffee.  

**Taste:** Thick mouth feel. Oily and rich. Some heat, but restrained. Rich stewed fruits, toffee and nutty sherry are the first things I notice, with a big wet, earthy, vegetal peat slap following. The PX and Oloroso play nicely together, bringing toffee, caramel and raspberries to blend well with pepper, tobacco, cocoa and stone fruit notes. 

**Finish:** Medium length, smoldering smoke and rich stewed fruits. 

**Overall:** This is 40% sherry bomb and 60% peat slap. Its really quite nice. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
