[**Review #12 | Bourbon Review #10 - Wild Turkey 101**]( https://t8ke.review/review-12-wild-turkey-101/)

**The Schtick:** No, no age statement. Yes, it was my college staple. This was picked up this year, in 2015, so lets see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey 

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, cinnamon and a faint hint of alcohol. For what Im guessing is now a much younger bourbon, the nose holds up very well. Also, very well blended for a healthy 101 proof. 

**Taste:** The cinnamon is there and overtakes the vanilla. Less sweetness than the nose would lead one to believe and a bit more burn. Its not particularly complex, but boy is it good. 

**Finish:** Short and a bit harsh, but well blended. You can tell this is a 101 proof dram, but its not punishing. 

**Overall:** I bought this way more than Id care to admit in college and its nice to see that it still holds up well. I enjoy it alongside a lot of other, nicer bottles but I dont feel that this ones inferior. Great juice for a really great value. 

Thanks for reading!
