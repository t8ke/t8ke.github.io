[**Review #741 | Rum Review #24 - Foursquare 2004 Mark III Cask Strength 11yr Rum**]( https://t8ke.review/review-741-foursquare-2004-mark-iii/)

**The Schtick:** This is a cask strength release from Foursquare. It spends 11 years in ex-bourbon. I had a sample of this many moons ago, and was silly enough to think "why should I write down my thoughts on rum?". That was foolish. I have procured another sample so that I can take down accurate notes and share them with you all.

**Distiller:** Foursquare

**Bottler:** Foursquare

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  59% ABV

**Age:** 11 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich brown sugar, pepper, clove, tobacco. Impressively bourbon-y. Mild overripe fruits, creme brulee. This smells like a very rich, fruity, bourbon. 

**Taste:** Thick, rich. Very mild heat despite the impressive proof. Sweet maple, molasses, lots of rich fruitiness. Almost like a banana split. Vanilla, clove, pepper and more brown sugar. 

**Finish:** Long and growing more rum like with lots of over ripe fruits, molasses and some faint funk presence. 

**Overall:** This is really rich and complex, with lots going on. Its a super bourbon like rum, but those two things play exceptionally well here. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
