**The Schtick:** Knob Creek Single Barrels have long been a product easily available at most stores. In the last several years, picking private barrels of various ages has become more commonplace. Picks between 9 and 16 years of age have been popping up with great regularity and Ive taken it upon myself to try a variety and see how they fare. Some time ago, Knob Creek exhibited what may have been the largest barrel variation commonly agreed on in the bourbon community with some barrels ranging from wretched to godly. It has been my feeling that, as of late, the overall quality of these barrels being picked has risen, adding a slightly higher floor than existed before.

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** PPLD

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Really prominent brown sugar, maple and nougat. Ethanol is here too but paired well with cinnamon, some more peanut brittle and a new sort of graham cracker note. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich, with mild heat. For the proof it is well restrained. Sweet cream and caramel dominate, with a nice balance of pepper and cocoa. Some graham cracker here also, kind of like a big smore. 

**Finish:** Medium length, no heat. Sweet honey and peanut brittle with very well restrained oak and pepper. 

**Overall:** Really nice pick, this one is older but doesnt show off any over oaking which is great. Sort of unique profile but totally enjoyable. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
