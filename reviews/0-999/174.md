**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Aberlour

**Bottler:** Aberlour

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 60.2% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Thick and heavily laden. Fudge. Caramel. Raisins. Figs. Raisins. Dates. Strawberries and Butterscotch. Sweet, deep and fruity.  

**Taste:** Sweet but hot, even with a little more time in the Glencairn (15 minutes is my usual resting period). Theres sherry for sure - figs and dates and raisins. Theres thick fudge and cherries. Dark chocolate and more caramel rise. Its delicious, intense and fruity.

**Finish:** Long and slightly punishing but for 120+pf, its really not unexpected. Punchy and thick, its really deep and complex. Massive fudge and sherry with little spice or clove. 

**Overall:** Everyone makes a big deal about age statements (myself included) but this expression from Aberlour really reminds me that age isnt everything. Aberlour consistently shines with the ABunadh. Its a favorite of mine. With all of this said, I score the Aberlour ABunadh Batch 45 a 7: well above average. In scotchland the herd is much thinner here - the ABunadh sits majestically among other favorites like GlenDronach CS, Compass Boxs This is Not a Luxury Whiskey, Springbank 12 Cask Strength and GlenDronach 12 (2013 Bottling). Thanks for reading!

Thanks for reading!
