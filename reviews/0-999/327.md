[**Review #327 | Rye Review #180 - Whistle Pig 10yr Single Barrel Cask Strength Rye KLWines Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-327-whistlepig-single-barrel-kl-select/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Alberta

**Bottler:** Whistle Pig

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:** 56.6% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Molasses, brown sugar, cinnamon, clove all spice. Like a saturday morning breakfast bomb

**Taste:** Thick, oily, clove, spice, massive maple and brown sugar. Heat is intensely subdued. Super sweet and some nice rye funk in the rear

**Finish:** Long, sweet, rich. Not too hot. Complex

**Overall:** This is the best thing going in rye right now. Im giving this a Rank 8. This is a fantastic rye with flavors I love and complexity that is only typically seen in much more expensive ryes. I think this hits up there with THH for me, so Im going to score it the same. And thankfully, you can actually find this in stores. Imagine that. This is what I drink when I want a nice bruiser rye but dont want to break out the diminishing last drops of my THH. I enjoy it immensely.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
