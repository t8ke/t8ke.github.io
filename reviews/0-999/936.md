**The Schtick:** This was a bottle that I tried blind and I reviewed it live on the Whiskey Network Discord server, then got the reveal in order to fill in relevant details here. 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** Wine and Whiskey Country

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, toffee, some light oak. Sweet and syrupy, only faint heat. No real fruitiness or overwhelming spice, sticking almost exclusively to sweet notes like cream, honey, toffee and nougat. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Solid heat, definitely present. Honey, clove, pretty apparent fruitiness here. Apples, pears, light clove, some pepper. Odd faint astringency, but not overwhelming. Tastes a hair on the young side, some grainy notes, some clove and pepper. 

**Finish:** Short to medium, some fairly prominent heat. Clove, pepper, some orange peel, faint spice. 

**Overall:** 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
