[**Review #14 | Bourbon Review #12 - I.W. Harper**]( https://t8ke.review/review-14-i-w-harper-bourbon-whiskey/)

**The Schtick:** IW Harper is a brand reboot managed by Heaven Hill. IW Harper was one of the producers of old. You can still sometimes see their 15yr age stated expression sitting on a store counter in its cologne style bottle, but thats priced about $70 above this release. For the record, this is the no age statement, $20 edition. 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Luxco

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  41% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sugar, pears, fruit, kind of like a shitty fruit rollup. 

**Taste:** Honestly, better than I was expecting. Its pretty sweet and tastes fairly young, lots of sugar and fruit. Very thin and watery though with more heat that it should be displaying, given the proof. 

**Finish:** Short and dissipates very quickly. Leaves behind some pear and then moves on to haunt its next victim with very little delay.  

**Overall:** Overall, this is a very flawed product. Its young, thin, hot, weirdly sweet and grainy. I went ahead and purchased it, so you dont have to.  

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
