**The Schtick:** I originally reviewed this a long while ago, and want to give it some new attention since I got a sample in a trade again recently. This is a 12yr cask strength release from Springbank - you may also have experienced their distillate if you like Hazelburn or Longrow, although these are produced a bit differently. 

-----

**Distiller:** Springbank

**Bottler:** Springbank

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 56.5% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Honey and sweet desserts - doughy barkery sweets. Toffee, fresh baked bread. Sherry fruits, though light, are present. Faint pepper. Smoke is very mild. The sherry is prominent.

**Taste:** Medium to thick mouthfeel with some heat, although it is fairly well restrained. Sweet with meon, sherry fruit and a good deal of vanilla + toffee. Pepper is in the mix and then it gets good. Lots of nice peppery smoke rolls in and balances the sweets nicely. 

**Finish:** edium legth. No real heat here. Sweet and smoky. Good deal of faint sherry, rich toffee and nice peppery smoke. 

**Overall:** This is an expression that is still managing to bring great quality to the table - and a delicious blend of sweet and smoky. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
