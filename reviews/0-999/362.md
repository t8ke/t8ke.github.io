**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Far North Spirits

**Bottler:** Far North Spirits

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 1 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Very sweet, almost cloying. Huge vanilla, grainy sweetness, simple syrup almost. Some earthy youthfulness, its definitely "green" and has some of that wet cardboard smell that I attribute to young rye.

**Taste:** Sweet, thin mouthfeel, some astringency. Very, very sweet. The cognac influence here is very strong. Its jammy, fruity, sweet and theres little clove, oak or spice to balance it out.

**Finish:** Short, hot, some astringency. Sweet, so sweet and a good deal of heat.

**Overall:** I thought maybe this would really have improved with air (at the bottom on my third of a bottle split with pals) and while its calmed down in the heat department, its just so sickly sweet it really doesnt matter. Im not going to write off Far North entirely, but I dont consider this good whiskey. At only a year old though, I didnt have insane expectations. Hopefully they can bounce back with some more age. Rank 3.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
