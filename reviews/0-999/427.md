**The Schtick:** Smooth Ambler has long since cut the production of the OG 7yr 99pf rye. Now, rye is only released from the gift shop in small, limited edition batches at cask strength. Usually, theyre pretty darn good. Lets see how this fella fares. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Smooth Ambler

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 58.5% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet molasses, brown sugar, minty spearmint. Lots of vanilla, some nice clove and a fresh hit of dill/mintiness. Yep, this is MGP. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich. Sweet cocoa and caramel, lots of vanilla and molasses. The clove and rye spice pack a whallop here also. Dilly mint is pretty prevalent also. 

**Finish:** Theres a bit of heat here but long finish. Minty but sweet. Theres a lot of maple here that helps to balance that MGP mintiness and it fades very nicely.

**Overall:** Welp, SAOS is still one of my favorite CS ryes to have around. I didnt like this quite as much as a 10yr gift shop rye I had a while back but this is still a phenomenal product that could trade blows with Thomas Handy or a really nice Whistle Pig store pick. 

Thanks for reading!
