**Bottler:** Plantation

**Selection:** N/A

**Nose:**  Apricot, pineapple, sweet toffee. Even a little bit floral. I recently had the pleasure of touring a pineapple plantation in Hawaii and this smells really similar to the nice plantation air. 

**Taste:** Rich mouth feel, sweet toffee, overripe fruit and a generous helping of pineapple. Theres some sweetness here but to my palate it feels very natural. Not an "added sugar" kind of sweet, nor is it artificial or cloying. Its just right. This makes it very pleasant to enjoy neat and I can think of about 15 cocktails I want to make with it.   

**Finish:** Medium, very pineapple forward and then settles down. No heat.  

**Overall:** Overall, this is a masterpiece. I had grave concerns with the first purchase that this would taste too pineapple-y, too sweet, cloying, artificial...the list goes on. It is none of that. This is a perfect product neat, on the rocks, with lime, with lime and soda water and the list is just endless. I dont consider price in my rating but the fact that you can find this under $30 is just remarkable.   

Thanks for reading!
