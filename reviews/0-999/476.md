**The Schtick:** These are single casks of Alberta rye, aged at WhistlePig and bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Alberta

**Bottler:** Whistle Pig

**Selection:** Vine and Table

**ABV:** 58.7% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Lots of ethanol, sweet sugar, fruity cream. Very familiar alberta rye spice.  

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, nice and rich sugar and caramel. There is a lot of heat though for the proof, its pretty hot. Loaded with pepper, baking spices and clove. Not as fruity as most Alberta barrels usually are. 

**Finish:** Short and astringent. Theres some nice oak here but the pepper overwhelms it and theres little sweetness to be found. 

**Overall:** Unfortunately, this is a miss to me. Its not terrible, but certainly not the level of enjoyment Ive gotten from just about every other WP SiB in the past. The profile just isnt there. Thats not very discouraging, though, since this is a single barrel product and I just dont think this barrel jives with me. There will be other barrels, and hopefully theyre better. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
