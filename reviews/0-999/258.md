[**Review #258 | Bourbon Review #142 - Wild Turkey 13yr Export (Japan)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-258-wild-turkey-distillers-reserve-13yr-export/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 45.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Turkey spice, cinnamon, clove, cinnamon bun and sticky vanilla frosting. Molasses, brown sugar, some citrusy orange peel

**Taste:** Medium thickness but oily coating and a very nice mouthfeel. Cinnamon, clove, oak, molasses, some odd Gobble funk, very complex and layered here. To me this feels like 101 turned up to 11.

**Finish:** Long and complex with a very heavy handed dose of that Wild Turkey sugar and spice.

**Overall:** This was a great dram and only helped make a great holiday even better. It was thick, complex and delicious and had everything I love from Wild Turkey. I wouldnt bend over and pay secondary for it, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. Im giving this dram a Rank 7.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
