**The Schtick:**  Wild Turkey 101 is a NAS offering bottled at 101proof. The mash is standard but barrel entry proof varies based on the era in which the barrels were laid down.

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet caramel, less spice but some heat here. Weird, bitter funk. Almost earthy but not in a pleasant way. Like rutabagas... is dis blantons?

**Taste:** Sweet and oaky, caramel and spice. Theres some cereal grains here and a faint hint of orange peel. Nice vanilla also, with some faint clove, pepper and leather. 

**Finish:** Medium in length. Nothing really too remarkable here, theres not a lot of heat but not a lot of much else either. Some sweets, some oak and then its gone. 

**Overall:** This was interesting and very different. I really dont know where to place it. The cereal grains were new and yummy but I didnt love the earthy bitterness for the same reason I dont like Blantons. Luckily they really only appeared in the nose which led the grains and orange to liven up the palate. Its a shame the finish didnt have more happening but Im going to let it sit at Rank 6. Unique and (mostly) great. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
