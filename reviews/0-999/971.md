**The Schtick:** This is a bottling of Highland Park spirit by Single Cask Nation - an Independent Bottler known by the Jewish Whiskey Company. This is distilled at an Orkney Distillery that isnt Scapa, as the cheeky documentation notes, so its very clear where this was distilled. This was branded as a collaboration between SCN and Hello From The Magic Tavern, an improvisational comedy podcast. I dont really know why this collaboration is a thing, but it has spawned a creative label for the bottle. 

-----

**Distiller:** Highland Park 

**Bottler:** Single Cask Nation

**Selection:** Single Cask Nation

**ABV:** 57.4% ABV

**Age:** 13 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Floral and sweet. Sweet, fresh baked, doughnuts. Caramel, toffee, vanilla butter cream. Rich honey, light fruits like currant, cherry and fig. 

**Taste:** Medium to thick mouth feel. Minor heat. Honey, syrupy stewed fruits. Nutty sherry. Caramel, toffee, pepper. Lots of tobacco and then ashy, woody, smoke rolls in. Currants, blackberries and fig blends well with the peaty smoke, more intense than HPs standard smoke profile. Burning wood, pepper, ash.  

**Finish:** Long, ashy, vegetal and sweet. Burning wood, faint bandage, light vanilla cream. Rich berries, sharp pepper and some tobacco. The finish is smoke dominated, with some nice fruity undertones. 

**Overall:** This is really nice, and transforms in very interesting ways from nose to finish. Really exceptional, especially with the blend of sweet fruits and ashy smoke. 

Thanks for reading!
