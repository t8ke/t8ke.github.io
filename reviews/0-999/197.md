**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Glen Scotia

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 57.69% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, salt and pepper with some light peat and ashy smoke. Lemon zest, butterscotch and a hint of salt and vinegar chips.

**Taste:** Gentle butterscotch, hay and pear. Theres some lemon and peat with a healthy dose of buttercream. Some thin smoke and a little ash.

**Finish:** Long and complex - more so than the palate. Sweet and salty with a hint of smokey. Super savory. I really am enjoying the floral aspect of it also. Delicious.

**Overall:** Overall, this dram is walking the 6/7 line for me. Its sweet and delicious, with some really savory notes also. Its very unique. I love the sweet and then in the next moment there is ashy smoke. I love it but I think it could have done a little better on the palate so Im going to stick to my guns and call this dram a 6. It was very close but just not quite there. In my gut, I feel that this is where the dram belongs. Sorry, Glen. No shame though, since at Rank 6 there are many good scotches and this Glen Scotia sits among pals like Balvenie 15 SiB, Glen Grant Decades and Glenrothes 11. Thanks for reading!

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
