**The Schtick:** This is a GlenDronach single cask from Astor wines in NYC that is 19 years old, distilled in 1995 and matured in Oloroso that is bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** GlenDronach

**Bottler:** GlenDronach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 55.7% ABV

**Age:** 19 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich sherry, sticky fruits, tobacco, earthy pepper. Stone fruits, nutty caramel, leather and moist tobacco. Rich cocoa.  

**Taste:** Thick and rich with no heat. Loaded with syrupy stone fruits, cocoa and leather. Earthy, rich tobacco, some pepper and really impressively thick nougat note. 

**Finish:** Long, rich but well balanced. Oak, pepper and tobacco mingle very well with cocoa, honey and toffee. 

**Overall:** This is just phenomenal and was a real treat to enjoy. I have had, and loved, a lot of PX releases before and this performs just as well in my eyes. Really good stuff. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
