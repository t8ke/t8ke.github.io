**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Peanuts and maple. Brown sugar and caramel with a healthy dose of oak. Sweet and woody without astringency or acetone like Elijah Craig Small Batch, which I dont love. 

**Taste:** Sweet and oaky. Mild pine. Healthy dose of molasses, peanut brittle and caramel. Average mouth feel but it coats nicely and introduces no unpleasant burn. 

**Finish:** Medium to long. Woody and sweet. reminds me of a caramel sundae. It has all of the flavors that I love and none that I dont. 

**Overall:** If you didnt heed my warning in the beginning, youre rude and I hate you. No, Im kidding. This is great stuff. It doesnt blow away in any one aspect but it is very solid, definitely delicious and priced like the year is 2005. I feel like Im stealing when I can still get 10yr BIB bourbon at less than $30. Im rating this bottle a 7: it certainly is well above average in my eyes. This means that Henry McKenna Single Barrel Bottled in Bond sits snugly next to 4 Roses Single Barrel, SAOS 8/9yr Single Barrel Picks and PHC:PoH. Not a bad place to sit, little buddy. Thanks for reading!

Thanks for reading!
