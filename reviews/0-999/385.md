[**Review #385 | Bourbon Review #385 - Wild Turkey 101 (2010 Export)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-385-wild-turkey-8-101-2010/)

**The Schtick:**  Wild Turkey 101 is a NAS offering bottled at 101proof. The mash is standard but barrel entry proof varies based on the era in which the barrels were laid down.

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.5% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Strong clove, corn, vanilla, brown sugar and cigar tobacco

**Taste:** Pretty good mouthfeel. Very clove heavy, vanilla, spice, some astringency. Mild orange. Some heat. Definitely Wild Turkey.

**Finish:** Medium but a bit of heat. Some astringency, lots of clove, vanilla and some faint cocoa.

**Overall:** Overall, this is pretty nice. Upon reveal, I was pretty surprised that this was one of the more recent export 8 yr bottles. I definitely couldnt tell through, what seemed to be, the additional astringency and clove heavy notes that I pick up in current WT 101 NAS. That being said, I still really enjoyed it. Sniffing it screams MIGHTY GOBBLE which is half the enjoyment of having a dram of WT to me anyways. Nose is delicious.

Thanks for reading!
