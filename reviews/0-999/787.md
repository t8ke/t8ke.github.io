**Nose:**  Honey, bread, toffee, caramel, some pepper and tobacco.   

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, no heat. Sweet caramel, faint melon. Pepper, mild smoke. The smoke here is sweet and ashy. No funk, iodine or vegetal influence. Overall, the palate is really delicious, albeit not super complex. 

**Finish:** Long and rich, peppery, with lots of vanilla and ashy smoke. 

**Overall:** This isnt the most complex dram in the world, but what it sets out to do, it does well. It is enjoyable, proofed just right and hits a great balance between smoky and sweet. 

Thanks for reading!
