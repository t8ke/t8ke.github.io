[**Review #807 | Rum Review #29 - Foursquare Premise**]( https://t8ke.review/review-807-foursquare-premise/)

**The Schtick:** This is a release from Foursquare, a Barbados rum producer, that is 10 years old and matured in a combination of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks. It is their 8th "exceptional cask" series release, and spends 3 of the 10 years in ex-bourbon and the remaining 7 years in ex-sherry. Like most of their other releases, it is a blend of pot and column production.

**Distiller:** Foursquare

**Bottler:** Foursquare

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years

**Nose:**  Vanilla, clove, pepper, tobacco and brown sugar. Rich sweetness, mild funk. Not super fruity. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Mild heat for the proof. Melon, molasses, banana, guava, brown sugar. Some oak. Nice and rich, faint fruitiness overall. 

**Finish:** Short, mildly astringent, molasses, nice funk component. Faintly meaty, tons of brown sugar with light pepper, clove, banana. 

**Overall:** This was good, but a little hot and not as complex as Foursquare has shown us they can be in the past. Surprisingly, the sherry influence was very muted despite its maturation time in the sherry casks. I dont think this was particularly bad, though. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
