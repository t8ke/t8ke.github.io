**The Schtick:** This was a blind sample that was sent to me. I reviewed it live on the Whiskey Network Discord server, then got the reveal in order to fill in relevant details here. 

-----

**Distiller:** PA Rye

**Bottler:** Frank-Lin Distillers Products

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.5% ABV

**Age:** 20 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Caramel, vanilla, clove, waffles, faint fruit

**Taste:** Thin/medium, heat, caramel, vanilla, cocoa, fruity

**Finish:** Short, mild fruit, cotton candy, vanilla, clove, pepper, banana taffy

**Overall:** rall: Good, but not great. Banana laffy taffy on the finish was interesting. Guessing a Brown Forman rye, 4-7 years, 45% ABV

Thanks for reading!
