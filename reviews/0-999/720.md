[**Review #720 | Rum Review #22 - Pussers Gunpowder Proof Rum**]( https://t8ke.review/review-720-pussers-gunpowder-proof-rum/)

**The Schtick:** This is a high proof release from Pussers.

-----

**Distiller:** Pussers

**Bottler:** Pussers

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 54.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet, syrupy, funky fruitiness. Molasses, maple, sweet icing. Banana, guava, faint apple, figs. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, syrupy molasses. Brown sugar, funky fruits, faint spice. Some faint heat, but not too bad for being 50%+

**Finish:** Medium length, lots of clove, overripe fruits and molasses. Sweet, mildly funky and rich. 

**Overall:** This is indeed much better than the previous Pussers Ive had. I enjoyed this thoroughly, and although I drank what I had neat, I bet this makes a really solid cocktail. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
