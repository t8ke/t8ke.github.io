**The Schtick:** This was a blind sample sent to me by /u/idriveavolvo. I tasted it, wrote down my notes then sent them over for reveal so I could fill in the pertinent information. 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Pears, apples, vanilla and faint creme brulee.   

**Taste:** Mediun mength, super vanilla and toffee forward. Faint sulfur, earthiness...faint salinity? If there is any peated component, its faint, if nonexistent. 

**Finish:** Medium, fruity, apples, melon, pear, faint sulfur, faint earthiness, faint sherry presence? 

**Overall:** This is super tough to guess. Flavors, mustiness and weird flavors abound. Im going to do my best, and my best guess is placing this as a Scotch single malt or blended malt with some sherry character. Im guessing the ABV is 43% - 46% ABV and unpeated, maybe sherried with refill PX. If I had to really guess, Id peg this as maybe newer GlenDronach 12 or some weird Walker Blended Malt. This was all sorts of weird and flew all around the ball park. When it came time for me to hit the pitch, I wiffed and wiffed hard. This was revealed to be Old Grand Dad 86pf 2004.Really shockingly weird, but there it is folks. Id like to think that I could tell the difference between a bourbon and scotch, but...so much for that. At least I got the ABV right? Hang it up folks. 

Thanks for reading!
