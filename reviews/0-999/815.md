[**Review #815 | Rum Review #31 - Mount Gay Extra Old**]( https://t8ke.review/review-815-mount-gay-extra-old/)

**The Schtick:** "An opulent blend of the finest spirits aged for 8 to 15 years. Where Eclipse is floral and fruity, Extra Old blends significantly older barrels of mainly double pot distillates that have rounded these crisper notes into a subtler balance. It exudes the finesse that only time can bring and offers a true taste of paradise from the rum that invented rum." - Mount Gays  Website
