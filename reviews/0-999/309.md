[**Review #309 | Rye Review #175 - Redemption Rye 8yr Barrel Proof Binnys Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-309-redemption-rye-9yr-barrel-proof/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Redemption

**Selection:** Binnys

**ABV:** 60.5% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Clove, cinnamon, huge (yuuuuuge) dill and spearmint. Like, unprecedented levels of mint. Ethanol, sweet maple.

**Taste:** Hot and rough, buttery maple, dill, cinnamon, mild metallic undertones. The profile here is good but 

**Finish:** Long, some metallic notes, good dill and some hot buttery toffee. Much hotter in the finish, a bit rough.

**Overall:** This is a great MGP rye and makes a tolderable substitute to the SAOS stuff. This would be labeled well as SAOS younger brother - hotter, rougher, a bit less polished around the edges. That being said, I enjoyed it. Im giving it a Rank 6 - patching up some of the roughness would have made this an easy 7.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
