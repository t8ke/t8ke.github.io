**The Schtick:** This is a 10yr, single barrel, cask strength release from Whistle Pig in Vermont, USA. They source the vast majority of their rye, including this cask, from Alberta in Canada and age stateside. 

-----

**Distiller:** Alberta

**Bottler:** Whistle Pig

**Selection:** Lukas

**ABV:** 59.65% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, lots of cream and fruity rye character. A load of clove and allspice. Really dense rye body, rich cinnamon. The token fruity Alberta notes are there, for sure. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich mouth feel. Lots of rye character with vanilla, caramel, faint melon and a nice peppery component. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and spicy. Theres some heat here but its well behaved.  

**Overall:** Another winner from Whistle Pig. I say it all the time but these casks are some of the best value in rye these days and the vast majority have been well above average, in my opinion. Really nice rye.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
