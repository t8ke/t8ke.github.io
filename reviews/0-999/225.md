**The Schtick:**

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Listmore

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Sweet cream, peppery spice. Mild smoke here with some rich toffee and smoke notes. Theres surprising amount of activity going on here.

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel but thats no surprise at the legal minimum ABV - theres a lot of complexity though. Seems like a catch 22 but isnt really a problem. Smokey and growing vegetal. Its like a light char kind of smoke with some peppery spice thrown in. Its surprisingly sweet though, with a lot of cream and very light caramel peeking through. A little fishy also. Im really impressed at how much is going on here. I expected a burning log and some nail polish remover thrown in a bottle and not much more.

**Finish:** Short but complex. No astringency, oddly sweet and creamy. The peppery, smoke and subtle vanilla toffee sweetness play really well together.

**Overall:** For a ~$20 bottle, Im pleasantly surprised. This is no show stopper, nor a Laphroaig QC competitor but at the price its sold at...it doesnt have to be. Theres a lot going on here and the creamy sweetness blended with the peppery peat is really quite pleasant. Im giving this dram a Rank 5 - it doesnt blow anything away but it makes for a surprisingly solid, hyper affordable daily sipper if smoke is your kind of thing.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
