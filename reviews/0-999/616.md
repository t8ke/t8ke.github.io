[**Review #616 | Bourbon Review #360 - Old Weller Antique Bourbon Chasers Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-616-old-weller-antique-bourbon-chasers/)

**The Schtick:** This is a well proofed wheater released from Buffalo Trace. It is a NAS product using the wheated mashbill. Old Weller Antique used to be a common, easily available and affordable product, but has recently been struck by the halo effect generated by Buffalo Traces other, higher tier products. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** Bourbon Chasers

**ABV:** 53.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet toffee. Light Werthers caramel candies. Faint red hot cinnamon candies. Overall, its nice and sweet, with a faintly warm finish, not unlike cassia. 

**Taste:** Thin, but no heat despite the proof. Sweet caramel, surprisingly nice oak presence. Red hot cinnamon candies, faint pepper. The oak here was unexpected and nice - just enough to balance what could have been a cloyingly sweet palate. Faint plastic astringency.

**Finish:** Short with some heat. Caramel and confectioners sugar is here in force with a mild bitterness on the backend. 

**Overall:** This certainly wasnt bad, but it was thin and featured some weird astringency / bitterness. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
