[**Review #42 | Bourbon Review #23 - Bookers Big Man Small Batch (2015-01)**]( https://t8ke.review)

**The Schtick:** Bookers is a Beam/Suntory product that is released unfiltered and at casks strength.

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 64.35% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Maple sugar bomb. Smells like a great waffle breakfast. Theres a lot more alcohol but I still feel like I get a lot less from this nose compared to ABunadh, which is one of the only other barrel proofers Ive had besides the Bookers here.  I like it, and I want more of it. 

**Taste:** Both the pepper and vanilla are more subdued here with a massive landslide of maple and molasses. Vanilla sneaks in at the end with some oaky wood to finish up. Still caters to my favorite bourbon profile very much. Yum. 

**Finish:** A little short, and a little hot, but not unreasonable given the proof. Sweetness continues.

**Overall:** This is a little off profile from other Bookers Ive reviewed, but not by much. Still enjoyable. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
