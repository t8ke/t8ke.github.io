[**Review #8 | Rye Review #8 - Sazerac Rye  **]( https://t8ke.review/review-8-sazerac-rye-baby-saz/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Pepper, caramel, butter and a nice spicy kick at the end

**Taste:** To me this is much much sweeter than a lot of other ryes, I get a TON of butter and sugar, with heavy vanilla seeping in before a nice rye finish. Despite its relative youth everything blends nicely into one another. 

**Finish:** Medium, although also well blended. Theres that rye spice but it doesnt kick you in the face. The butter and vanilla are there also.

**Overall:** Ive been told this is somewhat hard to find and I totally understand why. For the price and the age, this is a great dram. I snagged it for just under $30 and its absolutely well worth every drop. To me, this blows Double Rye! out of the water for less on the sticker and Id buy it again in a heartbeat. 

Thanks for reading!
