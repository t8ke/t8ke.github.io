**The Schtick:** This is a bottom shelf, blended scotch whiskey. I should be truthful here and let you all know I only suffered through half of this bottle. In the early Spring, the r/whiskonsin boys and I had a bottom shelf blends contest to see who could find the top of the flops, the best of the worst. This is leftover from that. Half the bottle has gone into odd frankenstein projects or cocktail blends. Only half was consumed for the purpose of attempting a quality review.

**Distiller:** Kininvie

**Bottler:** Clan MacGregor

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**   Ethanol, grain, honey. Young grainy notes, faint wet cardboard. Sickly sweet. 

**Taste:** Thin with some ethanol. Young apples, pears vanilla and honey. Its very sweet in a young distillate sort of way. 

**Finish:** Short and astringent. Sweet, faint fruitiness, some almonds. 

**Overall:** Honestly, I expected far worse. This is certainly bad, but oddly drinkable. I wouldnt drink a lot of it, but this might not make the worst scotch cocktail. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
