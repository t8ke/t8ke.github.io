**The Schtick:** This is the first time Bruichladdich is releasing an x.4 variant. Matured primarily in virgin oak and peated to 167ppm, this should certainly be an interesting adventure. One of 12,000 bottles released I got this for just under $200 in the states.

**Nose:**  First whiff brings a huge blast of custard and vine fruit, I get some odd melon here before the smoke rolls in. Its thick and rich, the smoke blends well with peat and a nice big BBQ gets started. Lots of vanilla and a strong hint of lemon. Pepper and some burning rubber start to sneak in. Its wild and all over the place, but it makes for an enjoyable journey.

**Taste:** Briney with a strong smokey punch. Theres some wood and sawdust with a good char kick. Notice Im using action words because it really is up and in your face. The vanilla, lemon, pepper and BBQ notes return in full force. All in all, its a very busy mouth feel. All over the place. 

**Finish:** Long and intense. It wouldnt be an octomore if it didnt last for ages. Its very smokey and peaty but isnt too punishing. I get a lot of vanilla and lemon zest on the out turn as well.  

**Overall:** Its all over the place but it is delicious. Wildly complex, it makes for a good dram when youre ready for an adventure. I hesitate to say Id buy it again - it was a lot of money. Id  rather have a PC, Bunna and Tamdhu all for less than the price I paid here for this bottle. All in all though, no regrets. Delicious and absolutely a must try. 

Thanks for reading!
