**Nose:**  Fruit and vegetation. W.t.f. Celery? Plums? Beans?   

**Taste:** Theres some honey. Theres some vanilla. Theres some...cucumber? Followed by some cherry? syrupy artificial sweetness. Minor, minor spice. Its definitely young. It has that "green" craft funk to it.  

**Finish:** Veggies turns to dill. Theres some artificial sweetness. Theres more cherries and cucumber. 

**Overall:** This is not good and it is far too young to be released.
