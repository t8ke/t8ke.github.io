**Nose:**  Sweet, cloyingly so. Sugar, orange, peppercorns. Spicy clove, cardamom. Lots of sweetness here, and a faint bitter component, reminiscent of Angostura.  

**Taste:** Thick, but sweet mouth feel. Lots of orange, honey, confectioners sugar. Heavy mulled spices, fake bubble gum note. Really heavy on the spice, lightly similar to Angostura. 

**Finish:** Short, no heat, super sweet. 

**Overall:** Neat: no. Rocks: no. Cocktail: yes. This is super sweet, and serves about a single purpose in my opinion. I hoped it would be fun on the rocks, but the sweetness is just overpowering. Blended with a tart citrus drink and ice, this is nice. 

Thanks for reading!
