[**Review #136 | Bourbon Review #73 - Very Old Barton Bottled in Bond #6**]( https://t8ke.review/review-136-very-old-barton-bib/)

**The Schtick:** This is the devilishly NAS edition of Bartons old 6 year age stated bottled in bond. 

-----

**Distiller:** Barton

**Bottler:** Barton

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Fruity and sweet, lots of molasses and vanilla with some cinnamon and a nice strawberry/raspberry note. 

**Taste:** Sweet and syrupy, much thicker mouthfeel than I expected. Not super thick, but not quite as thin as many bourbons. Mild spice, and lots more fruit. Raspberry, strawberry, vanilla and some nice clove.

**Finish:**  Medium, a bit hot but still delicious. Lots of vanilla and molasses here.

**Overall:** This is sweet and fruity, and deliciously so. Its not really sherry fruits like Im used to from the products across the pond, but brighter fruity notes like strawberries. This plays really well with the clove, cinnamon and vanilla from normal bourbon flavors. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
