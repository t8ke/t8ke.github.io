**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Stitzel Weller

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich maple, cinnamon, toffee, cocoa - this could almost be a completely different dram. Theres also a faint, savory note.

**Taste:** Thin mouthfeel, sweet with more savory notes. Clove, cinnamon, faint bubblegum, cola, cherry and some faint faint banana.

**Finish:** This is where the difference really seems to be from the 2016. Its medium but thick. No astringency here. The flavors from the palate are a bit muted but it makes for a much more pleasant exit. It feels far more well rounded and complex.

**Overall:** There are a lot of unique, but delicious notes here. I like it a fair bit more than 1792/VSOF 2016 etc Im going to give it a Rank 6. Wheaters still aint my jam, but its good and I cant ignore that. Im enjoying this trend of checking out all these Fitzies and Ill have a huge review of another coming up soon. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
