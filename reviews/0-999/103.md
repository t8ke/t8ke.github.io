**The Schtick:** Supposedly a blend of different aged distillate extending across 5 decades.  

-----

**Distiller:** Glen Grant

**Bottler:** Glen Grant

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Malty honey, light pear and apple. Light vanilla cream. Mild brine.

**Taste:** Sweet apple and pear. Mild salt and peppery brine. Theres some honey, a good dose of sneaky smoke and a strong malty sweet finish.

**Finish:** Long but mild. Its well blended between the sweet, smokey and salty.

**Overall:** I really had no idea what to expect from this dram but I liked it a lot. The profile was very unique and delicious. It started off one way and ended completely differently. Points for creativity.

Thanks for reading!
