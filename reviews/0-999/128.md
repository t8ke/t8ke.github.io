[**Review #128 | Bourbon Review #68 - High West American Prairie**]( https://t8ke.review/review-128-high-west-american-prairie/)

**The Schtick:** HWAP is a really interesting dram. The brainchild of our friends in Utah, AP is a cornucopia of 9yr+ whiskeys:

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** High West

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Light sawdust followed by spicy vanilla and molasses. Theres a good deal of rye spice here with some very faint dill.

**Taste:** To me, HW Ryes always shine with this odd metallic note. Its metallic, spicy and hot. Theres a good deal of molasses and leather bite to follow but then astringency kicks in the door. Dill follows although more muted than I would expect. Perhaps this is a clue into the proportion of MGP vs other ingredients. Its a bit astringent and all over the place.

**Finish:**  Short to medium, theres a lot of vanilla and ethanol burn. Astringent metal comes back with a hint of dill.

**Overall:** I enjoy a wide variety of HW products but this bottle is just all over the place. Theres odd metallic notes, its hotter than Id like it to be for only 92pf, and it just didnt leave me with a great impression. This wont dissuade me from trying more HW but I think I can conclude that this one just isnt really for me. 

Thanks for reading!
