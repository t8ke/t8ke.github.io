[**Review #160 | Bourbon Review #88 - Parkers Heritage Collection: Promise of Hope**]( https://t8ke.review/review-160-parkers-heritage-collection-7-promise-of-hope/)

**The Schtick:** This is another release in the Parkers collection, it comes out every spring. This is release #7 and it is a single barrel offering.

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  48% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Brown sugar, vanilla and cream, minty dill, some rye spice and a tiny bit of metallic zip. Theres also a weird cornucopia of fruit - banana, strawberry, grapes and a tiny bit of plum. 

**Taste:** Spicy vanilla, custard and apples. More grapes and strawberry here - kind of reminds me of a gusher again or some preserve. Some fudge trucks on it though which I think it interesting - normally I dont get much fudge in bourbons of lower proof but its here and its pretty delicious.  

**Finish:**  Medium to long. A tiny but hot but not bad. Lots of maple and molasses and fudge followed by lots of fruit preserve. 

**Overall:** This was nothing like what I expected - and Im still not sure what I was expecting. This is my first PHC expression and Id be interested to try more some time. Its interesting and all over the place but I kinda liked it in the end. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
