[**Review #87 | Bourbon Review #48 - Smooth Ambler Yearling**]( https://t8ke.review/review-87-smooth-ambler-yearling/)

**The Schtick:** A limited edition release of Smooth Amblers first bottling of their own spirit. Double pot distilled.  

-----

**Distiller:** Smooth Ambler

**Bottler:** Smooth Ambler

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 3 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Acetone, malty wood and oak followed by some caramel and this odd vegetal funk. Absolutely young new make notes abound. 

**Taste:** Sweet caramel and nougat followed by some plastic notes, more funk and some malty woodiness. This thing is literally all over the place. 

**Finish:** Short, hot and really funky. I cant put my finger on it but theres some real new make funk here. 

**Overall:** I sure cant say its good. This is a weird experiment from our pals at SAOS and I have to say that this is not one of my favorite offerings from them. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
