[**Review #961 | Scotch Review #322 - Benromach 15**]( https://t8ke.review/review-961-benromach-15yr/)

**The Schtick:** This is a well aged core line expression from Benromach, a Speyside Scotch distiller. 

-----

**Distiller:** Benromach

**Bottler:** Benromach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, caramel, graham crackers and smores. Really sweet, bread forward notes. Some faint smoke, some salinity here.   

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No real heat here. Ashy smoke, caramel and toffee. Nice and sweet, like a vanilla sundae with butter scotch, with some light ashy, wood-y smoke in the background. Fainy salinity. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and lightly smokey. This is really nice. Ashy and mineral smoke, with lots of vanilla, apple, toffee, vanilla and some light cocoa. 

**Overall:** Really good, and generally under rated, I think. This has a great nose and palate, and the finish carries nicely as well. If youre in the market for a sweet, bread-y, balanced dram with some present but not aggressive smoke, this is the dram for you.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
