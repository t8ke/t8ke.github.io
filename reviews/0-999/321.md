[**Review #321 | Bourbon Review #180 - Balcones Brimstone**]( https://t8ke.review/review-321-balcones-brimstone/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Balcones

**Bottler:** Balcones

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  53% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Smokey. Vegetal. Woody, ashy, oaky.

**Taste:** Ash, fire, dry smokey vanilla, tannins out the wazoo. This tastes like a bonfire, if one was physically in the bonfire.

**Finish:** Long, a good deal of heat, the woody, oaky, ashy, smokey char goes for miles.

**Overall:** This is a really, really, interesting dram and Im glad to have revisited it. Despite being all smoke, there are some interesting nuances there between all of the smoke. I dont love it, though, since its just a massive smoke overdose. It would be very interesting in a cocktail of sorts, though. Im going to give this a Rank 5 - its good and has no flaws but I dont see myself reaching for this all too often.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
