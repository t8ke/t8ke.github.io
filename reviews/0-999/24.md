**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Ardbeg

**Bottler:** Ardbeg

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 57.1% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Big peat and smoke. It smells salty, like the ocean with some medicinal bandage mixed in, although I noticed the iodine notes really diminish after about 15 minutes or so in the Glencairn. Theres no ethanol, which surprises me for a higher proof. Im getting some plasticy notes. A few more whiffs yield to some light citrus, maybe orange or lemon? Theres also a little vanilla as well. Its growing on me, as time goes by.

**Taste:** Its gentle, theres no hint of alcohol whatsoever. Im shocked by how complex and pleasant the mouthfeel is compared to the nose. Theres no bandages or iodine, just smoke. And warmth, Im not sure how to explain it but contrasted to bourbon, this dram warms my mouth. Maybe this is the result of how thick and pleasantly oily it is, but I know that I like it. Theres more plastic, some more brine - this strikes me a more forgiving than a dram of Talisker Storm I had some time ago. Theres a tiny amount of vanilla, but not as much as the nose. tl;dr: Thick, oily, salty and peaty but sweet and very well blended.      

**Finish:** The finish is long and once again, very gentle. No burn at all, and no real unpleasantness. Theres just a lot of salt and seabreeze with a little citrus and sweet. Im a fan.   

**Overall:** Deeply complex, pleasant to the palate. Worth trying. 

Thanks for reading!
