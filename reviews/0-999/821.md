**The Schtick:** "Chteau de Briat is operated by the Baron de Pichon-Longuevilles great, great-grandson, Stphane de Luze, who represents the fifth generation of the family to make Armagnac at the former hunting lodge of Henry IV. Distilled from Baco, the house style is a rich and full-bodied brandy that seemingly pays homage to the former kings spirited namesake: Bourbon." - KLWines Webpage.
