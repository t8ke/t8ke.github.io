**The Schtick:** This is the annual, sort of limited, Distillers Edition release from Diageo featuring Dalwhinnie spirit. The standard OB is 15 years, this sees an additional 24 months finishing in oloroso sherry casks.

**Distiller:** Dalwhinnie

**Bottler:** Dalwhinnie

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 17 Years

**Nose:**  Absolute honey overload. A funky baking bread note. Very little sherry, a lot of spice and the faint scent of marketing. 

**Taste:** Blast of floral honey. Theres a whole lot of honey. Spice kicks you in the face, which is weird given the lack of sherry here. This dram isnt peppery, bitter or astringent, its just....spicy. Not quite sure how to describe it. It lingers on my tongue. Theres a lot of influence from the oloroso here. 

**Finish:** Long, complex and even spicier. What is going on here? Im left with lots of flowers, honey and baked bread.   

**Overall:** This is interesting. I dont love it, but its unique. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
