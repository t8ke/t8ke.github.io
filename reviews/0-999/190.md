[**Review #190 | Bourbon Review #106 - Blantons Straight From the Barrel**]( https://t8ke.review/review-190-blantons-straight-from-the-barrel/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 66.65% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Malty and sweet. Cereal grains, caramel, sugar and cream. Mild cinnamon and clove but the nose is all about sweet on this fella.

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel despite the proof, and quite hot. Rough, sweet caramel and cream. Some corn and clove and cinnamon and theres not much more here. Its sweet and hot which is always an interesting combination.

**Finish:** The finish is long, which is what I had hoped. But its exceedingly hot for the proof. Its just not enjoyable to try and pull more notes here because the heat is crushing any other notable flavors except for sweet, cloying caramel.

**Overall:** Im not going to lie, and I have a feeling it will upset some or a lot of you, but I dont like this dram. Id take CEHT Barrel Proof, ECBP or Bookers over this sucker on any given day without a second thought. Its good, but really it doesnt shine as high as I was expecting it to based on the reactions of people trying to procure a bottle for themselves. I like that it is sweet but it really fell flat on my expectations. If I could, Id slot this sucker into a "budget barrel proof" category. Feels rough and hot - lets half the price and be realistic about what youre getting. Its a little better than the average, I wouldnt turn it down if handed to me, but you can bet that if I saw the shimmer of a Bookers box within a square mile Id drop this in a flash in favor of that. For all of those reasons, Im giving this dram a 6. A cut above but really it barely got here due to my love of caramel and malty sweet. Nonetheless, Blantons has been humbled and sits here at rank 6 with the likes of Eagle Rare 10, Smooth Ambler Old Scout 10yr and CEHT Single Barrel. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
