[**Review #592 | Bourbon Review #342 - Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve - Appalachian Whiskey Society**]( https://t8ke.review)

**The Schtick:** Knob Creek Single Barrels have long been a product easily available at most stores. In the last several years, picking private barrels of various ages has become more commonplace. Picks between 9 and 16 years of age have been popping up with great regularity and Ive taken it upon myself to try a variety and see how they fare. Some time ago, Knob Creek exhibited what may have been the largest barrel variation commonly agreed on in the bourbon community with some barrels ranging from wretched to godly. It has been my feeling that, as of late, the overall quality of these barrels being picked has risen, adding a slightly higher floor than existed before.

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** Appalachian Whiskey Society

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Syrupy maple. Vanilla and a funky candy note - like confectioners sugar, cotton candy or juicy fruit. Some graham cracker and pepper. 

**Taste:** Sweet caramel, toffee. Medium mouthfeel with very tame heat. Sort of a muted palate. Theres not a ton here which is sort of surprising. 

**Finish:** Medium length, growing heat. Bitter oak, pepper and clove dominate. 

**Overall:** Unfortunately, I found this specific barrel unremarkable. This is the first Ive found this lacking, but I think thats genuinely a good sign. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
