-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Compass Box

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 53.1% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Mild smoke, lemon zest, orange citrus, honey and the faintest brine

**Taste:** Sweet with mild smoke. lemon zest, orange peel and a good deal of honey and brine. Much smokier than the nose would lead on.  

**Finish:** Smokey but complex and sweet. It keeps growing smokier but its delicate, complex and sweet. Nice and floral also. Some pepper and lemon zest - like a peppery edible arrangement.     

**Overall:** I really like this whiskey.

Thanks for reading!
