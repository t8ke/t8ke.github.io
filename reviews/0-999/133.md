[**Review #133 | Rye Review #71 - Rittenhouse Rye Bottled In Bond DSP-Ky-354**]( https://t8ke.review/review-133-rittenhouse-rye-bib-dsp354/)

**The Schtick:** This is the previously distilled elsewhere edition of Ritt Rye.

-----

**Distiller:** Brown-Forman

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Rye spice, caramel and molasses, some minor leather and dusty wood. Little spicy

**Taste:** Molasses, spice and cloves. Cinnamon and a nice dash of vanilla at the end. Definitely a barely legal rye.

**Finish:** Oddly long and enjoyable, spicy followed by sweet.   

**Overall:** Theres not a ton going on here in this dram but I enjoy it. This is the old stuff though so its doubtful that Ill find it around me. Luckily I have a bottle of the new stuff to sample and compare soon. Good to drink neat, Im sure it makes a nice cocktail.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
