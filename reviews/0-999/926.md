**The Schtick:** 1792 Full Proof is typically a small batch, proofed release from Barton in Kentucky. Bottled at 125pf, it is hard to tell what the original barrel proof was for these releases, but all the same, 62.5% ABV isnt a bad number to run with. This is very similar to Knob Creeks Single Barrel Reserve, which is a release consistently diluted to 60% ABV and I like those all the way from fine to amazing. In this series, Im comparing a variety of Single Barrel releases from the Full Proof lineup, selected by various stores, vendors and societies in the USA.

**Nose:**  Honey, apples and pears, vanilla cream, light cocoa. Some light almond, ethanol.  

**Taste:** Honey, ethanol. Nice medium mouth feel. Vanilla cream, fruity apple tart, faint chalky character. Some bitter oak, light pepper. 

**Finish:** Long but very hot. Apples, vanilla cream, cocoa and rich oak. Faint tobacco. Mostly fruity and hot. 

**Overall:** This is nice, but very hot. It leans towards the fruity and oaky profile with notes like caramel and toffee that I usually find in bourbons taking the back seat. 

Thanks for reading!
