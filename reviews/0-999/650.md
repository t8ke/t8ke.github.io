[**Review #650 | Scotch Review #223 - Springbank 15**]( https://t8ke.review/review-650-springbank-15/)

**The Schtick:** This is the 15 year old member of Springbanks core line of products. Springbank is arguably one of my more beloved distilleries in Scotland, and they produce their spirit in Cambelltown.

-----

**Distiller:** Springbank

**Bottler:** Springbank

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey and vanilla. Loads of light, sherried, fruit notes. Faint smoke, some pepper. Nice, faint oak.  

**Taste:** Medium richness on the palate, really restrained heat. Sweet honey and vanilla are first to the show with big sherry presence following. Theres some nice smoke here and it blends very well with the sherry. The sherry profile leans more towards syrupy, fruity raspberries, strawberries and figs and isnt real nutty or earthy. 

**Finish:** Long and loaded with smoke. No heat, some sherry fruits return but the favor here is to the smoke. 

**Overall:** This is a very interesting dram, and it really keeps your attention given how much the profile evolves during the course of consuming it. This is really nice.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
