**The Schtick:** This is a liqueur produced by a local distillery. I didnt quite know where to put it, so I will just put it on my profile for now. 

-----

**Distiller:** Great Lakes Distillery

**Bottler:** Great Lakes Distillery

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  25% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich cranberry, fig, pomegranate. Sweet, but loaded with spice. Very reminiscent of fall spice and potpourri. Some cherry also.  

**Taste:** Thin, tart mouth feel. Cinnamon and cardamon are present, then the cranberry shines. Its evident that it is sweetened, but it isnt cloying. Nice spicy back palate. 

**Finish:** Short, tart and sweet. Nice spice. 

**Overall:** Overall, this is best in cocktails as would be expected. I found it to work great in sweeter gin, vodka and tequila based cocktails where the tart, drying sweetness shines. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
