**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill 

**Bottler:** Luxco

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years

**Nose:**  Lightly floral. Sweet cream. Caramel. A nice fruitcake-ish set of notes. Light, sweet, doughy. Not a lot of oak, dryness, tannins or notes like clove and leather.

**Taste:** Thin mouthfeel. Sweet and light. Vanilla reigns supreme here with a bit more of that fruity dough. Again, its sweet and inoffensive without more robust notes like clove, oak, leather, cinnamon, etc.  

**Finish:** The finish is surprisingly nice. No heat, good length. The fruit notes grow a little sour though, some oak represents and a good bit of vanilla steals the show. 

**Overall:** Despite the tone my notes may give - this isnt a bad product. I enjoyed it, but wasnt blown away. Its unique, though, and gives a little different feel than most oak or spice driven bourbons. Its light, doughy, fruity, sweet - everything a wheater typically is. That being said, it wasnt impressive. It wasnt really exciting. It was almost too delicate - the thin mouthfeel for a 100pf product was sort of a letdown. I wont hesitate to say I like this much better than Makers Mark but if you offered me this and a dram of Buffalo Trace, it wouldnt be an easy decision. I dont take price into my ranking, but for a product that is double or more at the register, Im not so sure thats a great impression to have been left with. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
