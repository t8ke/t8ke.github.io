**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Mortlach

**Bottler:** SMWS

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 55.9% ABV

**Age:** 28 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  sticky toffee, bakery sweets, yeasty dough, vanilla, cream, mild brine, thick caramel, mild damp woodiness

**Taste:** medium but coats well, sweet but hot, very cream and vanilla forward with toffee and caramel very prevalent.mildly floral and good citrus. Theres some meaty savor here also. Typical Mortlach. 

**Finish:** long some heat but complex and sweet

**Overall:** Overall, Im still riding the high from 26.105 but this was also a very high quality dram. I thoroughly enjoyed it and my faith in SMWS grows (still kind of new to trying all their things). There was some heat in the palate that I thought was oddly out of place but overall it still duked it out with a flavor profile I really enjoy while living up to the Mortlach game. For this reason, Im giving this a rank 7.  

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
