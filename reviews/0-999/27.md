[**Review #27 | Scotch Review #6 - The Balvenie 12yr Doublewood**]( https://t8ke.review/review-27-the-balvenie-12yr-double-wood/)

**The Schtick:** This is a Speyside product that is aged in ex-bourbon for 12yrs and then finished in sherry casks for nine months.  

-----

**Distiller:** Balvenie

**Bottler:** Balvenie

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey and sherry, lots of sherry notes but also mingling with floral scents. Like light wood, or hay, it reminds me of our old barn in the spring. Light and delicious. 

**Taste:** Theres a lot of floral, but also some newly arising citrus. This gives way to honey and mild peppery sherry spice. Theres some wood and a little oak spice as well. More sherry creeps in, but gently. 

**Finish:** Its a little short, but not rough. Theres some sherry but a little hot spice which gives way to a little honey. For what it is, I cant really complain.     

**Overall:** Solid but not phenomenal. I think the only real flaw I can point out is the rapidly escalating price, but that doesnt factor into the rating. The profile, though, is light and delightful and it does bring a good bit of flavor to the table. This will get a 5 and will be my baseline scotch ranking going forward. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
