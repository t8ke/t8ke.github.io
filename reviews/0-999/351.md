**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Heartwood

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 66.1% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Leather, butterscotch, caramel bomb. Mild cocoa, confectioners sugar. It is woody, sweet, chocolatey, brash. I have a feeling this will be a mouthfull - literally.

**Taste:** Sweet caramel. Thick, mild heat, rich, though. Passion fruit, sherry notes are really prominent here. Caramel, cocoa, fudge, floral in a way I cant describe. I wont try and BS it - this is hella unique. Im grasping for another note but I cant quite nail it down. Delicious though.

**Finish:** Long - theres a good punch of heat here. Rich, lasts for-fucking-ever.

**Overall:** Holy shitballs. This is not the best whiskey Ive ever had but it is absolutely at the top for uniqueness. I opened this sample with friends and we could all agree that this was really just a special snowflake - Ive not really had anything like it. It helps that it was also delicious, too. Thanks Slandy!

Thanks for reading!
