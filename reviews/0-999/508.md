**The Schtick:** This is a craft expression from Chicago Distilling company using a stout mashbill

-----

**Distiller:** Chicago Distilling Company

**Bottler:** Chicago Distilling Company

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Green, caramel, big stout notes. Lactic sour milk, wet carboard, ethanol. Smells hot 

**Taste:** Thin, sweet and very green. This is very young tasting. Prickly ethanol, wet cardboard. Cereal grains. Harsh wood. The stout notes are here but they dont integrate well with the whiskey

**Finish:** Short, hot and oddly lactic, stout notes are rich here. Not in a great way.

**Overall:** Funky, hot, young. Thats it, lets move on. Get me out of here. 

Thanks for reading!
