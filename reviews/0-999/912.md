[**Review #912 | Bourbon Review #477 - Elijah Craig Barrel Proof Batch A118**]( https://t8ke.review/review-912-elijah-craig-barrel-proof-batch-a118/)

**The Schtick:** Elijah Craig Barrel Proof is a 12 year old, cask strength, release from Heaven Hill in Kentucky. Batches were originally denoted by proof alone, but in recent times, since the bottle re-design, batches now get additional designation to help with tracking releases. 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 65.3% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, tobacco, caramel and cola. Rich nougat and vanilla cream. Light pepper influence.  

**Taste:** Oaky, rich caramel. Medium to thick mouth feel, pepper, tobacco and thick tannins. Heat comes storming in. 

**Finish:** Long, but very hot. Almost punishing. Oaky, dry pepper. Lots of tobacco, vanilla cream and some cherry cola.    

**Overall:** I like this, but it was much hotter than other batches Ive  had and that will unfortunately drop this a notch or so. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
