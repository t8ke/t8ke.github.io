**The Schtick:** This is a wheated whiskey produced by a craft distiller, finished in port. 

-----

**Distiller:** Dry Fly Distilling

**Bottler:** Dry Fly Distilling

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 3 Years

**Nose:**  Really robust port here. Sweet candy, red hots, caramel, toffee. Really reminiscent of Old Fitzgerald Bottled in Bond. But with port. 

**Taste:** Thin, no heat though. Cocoa, fig, faint strawberry jam. Some caramel. Not super complex, not super robust.

**Finish:** Short, no heat. Port is really noticeable here. Faint bitterness. 

**Overall:** Unique but not exciting or exceptional by any stretch. The nose and palate were pretty nice though. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
