[**Review #765 | Scotch Review #258 - Ardbeg 21yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-765-ardbeg-21/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 2017 release of 21 year old Ardbeg spirit - it is non chill filtered and released at 46% after spending its life maturing in ex-bourbon casks. There is no mention of coloring in Ardbegs site or documentation. Lets dive in.

-----

**Distiller:** Ardbeg

**Bottler:** Ardbeg

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 21 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Buttercream, lemon-lime soda. Toffee, ashy smoke. Tar, pepper, burning wood. Lemon meringue, floral essence, faint rubber. Overall, its very sweet, mildly fruity and has a nice peat / smoke component that balances nicely.

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, vanilla. Super sweet. No heat. Lemon meringue, oak, pepper, tobacco. Whipped cream. Ashy, coal tar, burning wood and some faint rubber. Its not astringent, however, and the peat and the sweet notes blend really nicely. 

**Finish:** Long, but mild. No heat. No astringency. Sweet and ashy, lots of sweet cream to pair with a woody, ashy peat. 

**Overall:** Its very complex and I like it quite a bit. I wish dearly we would see these releases at cask strength, but I have to admit, Im surprised by how much I like this. Its complex, nuanced and delicious. 

Thanks for reading!
