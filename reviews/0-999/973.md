**Distiller:** Laphroaig

**Bottler:** Single Cask Nation

**Selection:** Single Cask Nation

**ABV:** 57.9% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years

**Nose:**   Honey, almonds. Strong bandages and smoke, that iodine peat presence is unmistakable. Big bright lemon zest, faint salinity and rich vanilla cream. 

**Taste:** Thick, rich, no real heat. Sweet and loaded with vanilla cream. The peat smoke swoops in though, bringing bandages, vegetal funk, iodine and caramel with it. Big pepper also makes a strong appearance. Its impressively sweet with lots of caramel, toffee and peanut brittle. 

**Finish:** Short, rich and smokey. Lots of caramel and vanilla here, touch of salt, and a bright peaty finish. In your face, but doesnt last for hours. 

**Overall:** I really had doubts about a 5yr Frog, but this was really incredible. The caramel note was welcome and integrated very well with the profile of peat and smoke that Laphroaig sets out for. I thought this was phenomenal.  

Thanks for reading!
