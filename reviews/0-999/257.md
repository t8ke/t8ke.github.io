**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Balvenie

**Bottler:** Balvenie

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 47.8% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, dough, yeast bakery sweets. Passion fruits, figs, plumbs, date fruit and sweet chocolate.

**Taste:** Medium and oily, the extra proof does very well with this one and I appreciate it. Sweet plum forward with a light dose of oak and cocoa. More honey, more doughnut sweets follow. Overall its a sweet dram and more focused in the light, floral, fruity corner of the sherry arena, rather than the dense sticky cocoa corner of the arena. Nothing wrong with that.

**Finish:**  Long, warming, sweet and syrupy with only a little hint of prickly proof. This dram behaves very well on the way out.

**Overall:** I really like this dram. Theres only one problem....its $115-$135 where I live and thats absurd. This dram is delicious and brings a ton to the table but pricing like that is bonkers and reminds me why its not in my collection. I really enjoy it though and its sweeter look at sherry always leaves me appreciating any samples I try. For these reasons, Im giving it a Rank 6.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
