[**Review #485 | Scotch Review #174 - Gordon and MacPhail Speymalt Macallan**]( https://t8ke.review/review-485-speymalt-macallan-gordon-macphail-9yr/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 9 year old IB offering from Macallan. 

-----

**Distiller:** Macallan

**Bottler:** Gordon MacPhail

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Apple, pear, sweet sherry. Vanilla dough, yeasty, honey like sweetness. Butter cream.  

**Taste:** Thin but sweet and loaded with honey. Apples, pears, honeydew and cream. Not as complex as the nose but still enjoyable. 

**Finish:** Medium with some faint heat and astringency. Melon, vanilla and some butter cream cake notes. 

**Overall:** This is really interesting. I expected something unusual to Macallans typical profile and I got it. It seemed very cake and fruit forward. I wanted to like it more but the finish wasnt up to snuff with the rest. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
