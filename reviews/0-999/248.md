[**Review #248 | Rye Review #136 - High West Double Rye Black Muscat Finish**]( https://t8ke.review/review-248-high-west-double-rye-blask-muscat-finish/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** High West 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 47.4% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Heavy heavy rye spice. maple, gingerbread, clove, spice, its really spicey and baking note forward. i feel like after sniffing this the gingerbread man is going to come assault me.

**Taste:**   Sweet for a moment but then the hammer of spice returns. Im not sure how much here is the rye and how much is the finish but its very fruity, syrupy and sweet. There is metallic dill notes and then a massive whomp of baking spice again. Its weird. I kind of like it, but its certainly unique.

**Finish:** Medium with some heat.

**Overall:** To me, this is far better than the AP Orange Muscat but theres a ton of variables. They are nothing alike save for the word Muscat in the names. One is a bourbon finished in orange muscat and one is a rye finished in black. I think its better but I also tend to like rye better.

Thanks for reading!
