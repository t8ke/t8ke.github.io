**The Schtick:** This is a single grain whiskey that is 6 years old and matured in an ex-bourbon cask. 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Hyde

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Really rich toffee, bright and floral. Tons of mango, orange, lemon, plum and sweet lime zest. Really surprising. Sweet butter cream. Light baked bread.  

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. No real heat. The fruitiness continues. Really interesting. Lots of passion fruits, raspberry, vanilla and some tobacco. Vanilla icing, confectioners sugar, almost candy like. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length. Really sweet again, loads of fruit and citrus. Not what I expected at all. Really surprising. 

**Overall:** I like this, but its super sweet and the floral and fruit notes are very powerful. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
