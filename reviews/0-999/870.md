**The Schtick:** This is an interesting rum product that is produced in India. It bears an age statement of 7 years and is bottled at 40% ABV, so its not a win all around. For $17 locally, I decided to give it a go.

**Distiller:** Solan

**Bottler:** Solan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years

**Nose:**  Sweet maple, almost bourbon-y. Molasses, sweet sticky caramel candies. Mild funk, woody, faint tobacco. Sweet sugar, raisin bread. Sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.  

**Taste:** thin, no heat. Syrupy sweet, raisin bread, tobacco, cocoa. Its sweet but not crazy on the dosing. Lots of cherry, cocoa, tobacco.

**Finish:** Short, sweet, cocoa, maple, brown sugar, bready. 

**Overall:** This is fine enough. Its not crazy complex but its also not offensive in any way. It performed well neat, on the rocks and in a variety of cocktails. It wont blow you away, but I dont think it was ever intended to. 

Thanks for reading!
