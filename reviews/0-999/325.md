**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Clynelish

**Bottler:** Gordon MacPhail

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  54% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet caramel yeasty baking sweets toffee confectioners sugar salted caramel

**Taste:** Medium richness. Lots of sweet toffee, caramel vanilla baking sweets. Mild fig, some lemon zest and a tiny hint of sea air. Doughy sweetness as well.

**Finish:** Long finish with mild heat. Sweet bakery notes, mild pepper, lemon zest. A good bit of vanilla here mixed with perhaps some pear or light sea air again.

**Overall:** This was a really interesting look at the blend of standard ex-bourbon Clynelish with some sherried included as well. This is one of my favorite profiles and I think it is handled very well. Im going to give this a Rank 7. Clynelish nails it again. Hnng.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
