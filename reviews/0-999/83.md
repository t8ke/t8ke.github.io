[**Review #83 | Bourbon Review #45 - Elmer T. Lee (2015)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-83-elmer-t-lee-2015/)

**The Schtick:** This is a Mashbill #2 product from Buffalo Trace. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet vanilla, custard, light floral fruit and very, very mild cinnamon.   

**Taste:** Vanilla, sugary sweet, some spice and mild fruit. Not terribly complex. 

**Finish:** Short and mild. Its not a bad finish but it doesnt have a ton of character. Really light and sweet. 

**Overall:** This is a good entry level bourbon. Its sweet, gentle and completely approachable. I can understand why it has become fairly hyped - the combination of complete inoffensiveness and some perceived level of rarity makes this bottle ideal for people to add to their collections. At the end of the day, though, its just a fine dram, and nothing more. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
