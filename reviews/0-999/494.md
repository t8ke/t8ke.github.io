[**Review #494 | Scotch Review #179 - Cutty Sark (2017)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-494-cutty-sark-2017/)

**The Schtick:** Another bottom shelf blend. I should be truthful here and let you all know I only suffered through half of this bottle. In the early Spring, the r/whiskonsin boys and I had a bottom shelf blends contest to see who could find the top of the flops, the best of the worst. This is leftover from that. Half the bottle has gone into odd frankenstein projects or cocktail blends. Only half was consumed for the purpose of attempting a quality review.

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Cutty Sark

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet vanilla, lots of perfumey floral notes. Grain.  

**Taste:** Thin, really faint notes like apples, honey, pear, grain, astringent rubber notes. I say theyre all faint because theyre hidden under a blanket of ethanol thats none too pleasant to dig into. 

**Finish:** Short, astringent rubber notes. Some apple. Mostly grain. 

**Overall:** This was dreadful and consistently so. It wasnt as bad as Slaughterhouse, though, so that has that going for it. Surprisingly though, this won the blind test against other dreck. Despite that discrepancy, I dont think people will be rushing out to buy it. 

Thanks for reading!
