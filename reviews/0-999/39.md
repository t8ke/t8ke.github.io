[**Review #39 | World Review #4 - Tyrconnell Sherry Cask**]( https://t8ke.review/review-39-tyrconnell-sherry-cask/)

**The Schtick:** This is produced at the Kilbeggan distillery and matured in a sherry cask. 

-----

**Distiller:** Kilbeggan

**Bottler:** Kilbeggan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sherry and raisins followed by plum and syrupy grape. Theres also a funky metallic note, which isnt off putting, but is present and interesting. 

**Taste:** Sherry and sweet leathery spice, followed by more plum/raisin syrupy sweetness. I like it. Coats nicely and has a decent mouth feel with good oiliness.

**Finish:** Shorter than I was expecting but still not too bad. A little hot and a lot less sweet than the nose or mouth feel would lead you to believe, but all of the typical sherry notes are there. The metallic note from the nose is joined by a subtle plastic-y note but its not terrible. 

**Overall:** This is really interesting but ultimately the finish was a little disappointing. Id rather have something like Aberlour 12NCF or a GlenDronach.  

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
