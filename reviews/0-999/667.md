[**Review #667 | Bourbon Review #385 - Four Roses OBSF Private Selection Loch and Key Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-667-four-roses-private-selection-obsf-loch-and-key-selection/)

**The Schtick:** Four Roses releases single barrels of a specific recipe at cask strength as their private pick program. This is one of the best values in cask strength bourbon that heralds quality and availability, in my personal opinion.

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** Loch and Key

**ABV:** 58.6% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, toffee, some rich floral pepper. Fruity and spicy with a lot of prominent vanilla character. I always find myself impressed at how Four Roses can pull off a nice floral tone without getting too out there. 

**Taste:** Sweet, loaded with toffee. Some nice oak character, some hearty tobacco and a rich fruitiness. Theres mild heat, but its in check. The combination of sweet, fruit, oak and vanilla is really pleasant here. Strangely like an apple pie. 

**Finish:** Medium length with some faint heat. Nice fruity blended with some rich oak. 

**Overall:** I enjoyed this. It was definitely a little different, but solid. Keep up the good work, 4R.

Thanks for reading!
