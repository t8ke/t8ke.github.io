**Bottler:** Stranahans

**Nose:**  Holy balls. Theres an initial overload of corn, followed by the gentle entrance of brown sugar. Lots of brown sugar. This blends nicely with finer notes of vanilla and molasses.

**Taste:** It tastes a bit different than I expected from the nose. Lots of cinnamon to begin with and then the old usual suspects creep in like I thought they might. Vanilla, followed by brown sugar. Its warm, sweet and coats nicely for the proof. Theres some faint stewed fruits, honey, clove. 

**Finish:** The finish is long and complex, leaving behind some smooth molasses and spice. I love it.  

**Overall:** Overall, I really enjoyed this dram. It was certainly unique, but Ill be interested to try other Snowflake releases also. 

Thanks for reading!
