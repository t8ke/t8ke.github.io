**Nose:**  Ethanol, corn, theres some nice wine sweetness followed by a malty sweetness. Some cinnamon, some spice and one more fruity kick.  

**Taste:** Its a bit thin but theres lots of mild spice, vanilla and a malty wood note. The wine is gentle and well blended which I think is a good thing - its a young whiskey finished and its good to see the wine isnt covering anything up. Theres a bit of red fruit and a little woody earthiness. 

**Finish:** Short to medium, but a bit more complex than I expected. Theres solid bourbon notes like oak, cinnamon and some molasses melded gently with some wine notes. The finish here really goes well with the mouthfeel and salvages this dram, in my opinion. 

**Overall:** KK is young whiskey and I was hesitant to try young whiskey with a funky finish. I wrote it off. Then, I was at a local bar that happened to have a bottle and after a couple beers, I had to give it a shot. I was in love. I think I might have also been a tad inebriated. But regardless, I sought out to find a bottle. While this doesnt quite live up to my intoxicated opinion, its still really quite good. The wine finish does great things to the young whiskey without covering up the flavor profile. I think its an alright, if educational, bottle all in all. 

Thanks for reading!
