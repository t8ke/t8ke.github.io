[**Review #662 | Scotch Review #226 - Johnnie Walker 10 Years Old Rye Cask Finish 46%**]( https://t8ke.review/review-662-johnnie-walker-select-cask-10-years-old-rye-cask-finish/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 10 year blended expression from Johnnie Walker that is matured for 10 years in virgin oak casks, and then finished in ex-rye whiskey casks. There is no information given on the provenance of the rye casks. It is also prudent to note that this is a blended scotch whiskey and not a blended single malt which means there is also likely to be some grain in the mix. It also sounds like we may be seeing more of these releases since this is the first edition in their Select Cask range. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Johnnie Walker

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Ethanol, confectioners sugar, some younger new make, grain notes. Lemon butter cream, faint rubber. Its really funky, not really that bad, but it hovers and seems to pinball between sweet and creepy and then it is ethanol forward and rubbery in the next moment. Weird. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouthfeel. Butter cream is prominent here. Very, very faint smoke. Sweet and tastes much younger than 10 years. Some clove spice. Fairly pleasant palate experience after the nose. Interesting. 

**Finish:** Short and mild with sweet clove, faint rye spice, and toffee. Theres a bit of astringency here, but nothing egregious. 

**Overall:** Overall, this wasnt actively bad. It doesnt measure up to most other scotches, so I feel like a 4 here is appropriate but I was pleasantly surprised by the interesting flavors throughout. The astringency in the finish and the "all over the place"-ness on the nose is really what cripples this. I will definitely be interested to see what future iterations of this product we see in new releases, though. 

Thanks for reading!
