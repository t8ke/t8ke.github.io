-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Spencerfield Spirit Co

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, caramel, tobacco. Stewed fruits, jammy. Mild pepper. Bready. Sherry is pretty prominent.   

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, no heat. Sweet honey, figs, jammy raspberry. Vanilla, caramel, cream. Tobacco, really rich for the proof. 

**Finish:** Medium length, only mild heat. Sweet and fruity, jammy and rich. Some caramel and yeast, as well. 

**Overall:** This is really a great bottling, despite it being hard to find and generally not well known. I was beyond surprised and quite impressed. Its going to be a pretty clear shelf staple for me, going forward. 

Thanks for reading!
