[**Review #510 | Bourbon Review #292 - Henry McKenna 10 Year Single Barrel Bottled in Bond (2003)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-510-2003-henry-mckenna-10yr-sib-bib/)

**The Schtick:** This is an older release of a commonly very popular product, released by Heaven Hill

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, sweet oak. Caramel, vanilla, toffee. Really rich nose.  

**Taste:** Thick and rich. Sweet honey, vanilla and a nice oakiness. The oak is present here but its sweet and not at all bitter or overly tannic. Really well integrated. 

**Finish:** Medium in length, growing a hair spicy. Some nice allspice and cracked pepper. Sweet honey continues and there is a good deal of maple as well. 

**Overall:** This is really pretty delicious and goes to show how different it was even just shy of 15 years ago. Its thicker, richer and the oak is very well integrated into the overall profile. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
