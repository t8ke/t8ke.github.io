[**Review #891 | Rum Review #47 - Foursquare Principia**]( https://t8ke.review/review-891-foursquare-principia/)

**The Schtick:** This is a single blended rum from Foursquare in Barbados. It is a blend of pot and column distilled distillates and was bottled with no additives. It is aged for 3 years in ex-bourbon and then another 6 years in ex-sherry. It is bottled at cask strength and was matured exclusively in the tropics.

**Distiller:** Foursquare

**Bottler:** Foursquare

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  62% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years

**Nose:**  Rich molasses, brown sugar, honey and tobacco. Super sweet, loaded with savory sweetness. Lightly floral, some nice mild rotting fruit. Overripe bananas, almost like a savory bananas foster. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Some heat. Sweet cream, molasses, brown sugar, banana and guava. Overall, very much a savory sweet with lots of molasses, brown sugar and some faint fruity undertones. Very on profile for Foursquare.   

**Finish:** Long, but hot. Not super complex, just heat, brown sugar and some overripe fruits. A bit of oak here, faint pepper. While its hot, its not punishing considering the proof.  

**Overall:** I liked this a bit but the finish was sort of a let down. If I had to compare this to a product in their current lineup, I would say that this is very clearly a similar profile to Foursquare 2004. The finish was a hair rougher, though, so I think I will give this one rank under 2004, which I would probably take over this if I could only choose one. By no means a bad dram, though - its a great look at a rich, complex, on profile Foursquare offering. Strangely enough, the sherry is very muted, and doesnt show through much, if at all. I dont think this is a bad thing.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
