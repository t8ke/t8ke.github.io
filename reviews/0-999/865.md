**The Schtick:** This is a murky release coming from Chattanooga Whiskey - they mention that isa  robust blend,  selected for high proof cask notes. But, I dont see anything proclaiming this as true cask strength. Im curious. From what I can tell, they are producing their own spirit, but there is little documentation online. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Chattanooga Whiskey

**Selection:** McScrooges

**ABV:** 56.8% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Honey, malt, faint baked bread. Some caramel, vanilla, light fruitiness. Smells sort of like a cross between MGP and some BT Mashbill 1 fruitiness. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouthfeel, lots of heat. Melon, sugar, spicy pepper. Only faint oak. No craft notes. Mild tobacco. Leaning more towards savory rather than sweet. 

**Finish:** Medium, really quite hot. Fruity, pepper, mild oak.

**Overall:** This is nice, but also suffering from being too hot for its own good. I can see this being young MGP.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
