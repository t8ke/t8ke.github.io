**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  55% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Huge, deep, thick sherry. Syrupy sticky PX. Chocolate cocoa, maple, vanilla, figs, dates, plums.

**Taste:** Rich, oily, dense sherry fruit. Bit of heat and more noticeable sulphur. Figs, pound cake, cocoa, plum, raspberry jam, maple candies. This one has a 

**Finish:** Long, complex, theress a good deal of heat but its well blended. Its not too sickly sweet - definitely not cloying. This is delicious and rich and warming.

**Overall:** This is another phenomenal dram and Im tickled to have tried some. Like I said above, Im starting to wonder if the sweet spot for these is 18-20 years but thats just a hunch. Ill never stop trying to sample as many of these as I possibly can. Im giving this a Rank 8 - the palate and complexity and finish make this a very enjoyable and very impressive sherry bomb despite the price. This dram sits next to other GlenDronach single casks Ive had as well as Longrows RED Shiraz bottling and the Bruichladdich Cuvee bottlings.

Thanks for reading!
