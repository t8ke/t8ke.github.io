**The Schtick:** This is a release of unpeated Ardmore distillate that is bottled by Signatory Vintage and selected by Winebow. Ardlair is the name given to spirit that is unpeated, and this was matured in a refill sherry butt. 

-----

**Distiller:** Ardmore

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage

**Selection:** Winebow

**ABV:** 63.3% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, apples, pears, crisp citrus. Almost candied fruits. Sweet, confectioners sugar. Almost swedish fish, like. Weird descriptor. Light smoke. Faint salinity. Rich, baked bread. Yeast-y sweetness. Honey and vanilla bean. Definite lactic quality. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Really subdued heat for the monster 63%. Loads of buttery bread, caramel, butter scotch, honey and toffee. Really sweet. This gives way to some faint salinity, and a subdued smoke characteristic. The candied notes remain, more like peach rings and strawberry candies. The lightly lactic note remains. 

**Finish:** Long and sweet. Smoke character is a little more prominent, but still pretty subdued behind the sweet, bread-y character.

**Overall:** Overall, I really enjoy this. Its weird, different, and unquestionably unique. Its relative youth is deceptive, and there are a lot of flavors I really enjoy in a bold display. 

Thanks for reading!
