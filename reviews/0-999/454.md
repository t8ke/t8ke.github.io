**The Schtick:** This is the final phase of Gobble Til You Wobble and Ill be looking at both the Bourbon and Ryes that are sold under that line. Bourbons first, ryes second. This is a modern offering from Wild Turkey with the higher entry proof. It is diluted to 110 pf and sold as a single barrel offering across the nation. Many stores have been able to do picks of these products, and extra information is available as a result. It is, still, a NAS product, though.

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** Gomers

**ABV:**  55% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Clove, cocoa and honey. Theres some faint citrus peel, graham cracker. Lots of turkey spice and cracked pepper.

**Taste:**  Hot spicy pepper is the first thing I pick up. Cloves, baking spices, cinnamon. Theres only faint sweetness here, its mostly hot and brash peppery spice notes.  

**Finish:** Short, hot and brash. Pepper and oak is all I can pick out here and its packing heat with a vengeance.

**Overall:**  I did not like this pick. Unfortunately, it was very one dimensional in that it was hot and loaded with all things spicy. Without a good deal of sweet in the palate to balance, this one kind of falls to its own demise. Oh well, on to the next!

Thanks for reading!
