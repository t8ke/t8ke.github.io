[**Review #338 | Bourbon Review #338 - Westland Cask 405**]( https://t8ke.review/review-338-westland-cask-405/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Westland

**Bottler:** Westland

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 62.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet vanilla, doughy pastry, some thin white grape notes, very fruity and floral

**Taste:** Sweet - very fruity. Lots of grape, pear, apple, some raspberry. Doughy yeasty sweetness. Thin mouthfeel but coats nicely. Some cocoa popping up here. This is really unique. Its also all over the place. Like, ADD on the flavor dial, all over the place.

**Finish:** Medium, good balance of heat and flavor. TONS of fruit, mild cocoa and some toffee.

**Overall:** This is weird. This is funky. I think I kind of sort of like it, but this is a mood dram. Its like an adult juice box. Huge fruit. Its just not great, though. Its wild, all over the place, shows little restraint or complexity and nuance, etc. Ill award it Rank 5 due the uniqueness and some pleasant flavor. Its a shame that whats in the bottle sells for what it does.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
