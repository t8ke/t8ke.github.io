[**Review #129 | Rye Review #69 - WhistlePig 10yr 100% Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-129-whistlepig-10yr-rye/)

**The Schtick:** This is rye sourced from Alberta in Canada. It is aged and bottled by WhistlePig in Vermont, USA. 

-----

**Distiller:** Alberta

**Bottler:** Whistle Pig

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rye spice, caramel and butterscotch. Its woody, I get some pine and some oak notes with a very faint metallic note. I seem to pick this note up in a lot of ryes, but its a good metallic note, not a bad one.

**Taste:** Sweet funky rye spice. Its hot, but has a nice thick, oily mouthfeel. Mild plastic notes but soon replaced by cinnamon, molasses and one more good rye spice kick.

**Finish:** Medium-long, its a complex blend of spicy and sweet with the brown sugar/molasses and rye spice playing nicely off each other.  

**Overall:** Im a sucker for SAOS rye but this was a really great change of pace. Delicious, and generally high quality. Their single barrel, cask strength store picks are a whole other level though, and I cant suggest this over one of those, when taking price into consideration. 

Thanks for reading!
