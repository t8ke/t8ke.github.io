[**Review #100 | Bourbon Review #57 - George T. Stagg (2015)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-100-george-t-stagg-2015/)

**The Schtick:** This is one of the bottles in each years lauded Buffalo Trace Antique Collection releases. Its barrel proof, well aged at ~15 years, mashbill 1 BT distillate. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 69.1% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Massive molasses. Cinnamon. Vanilla. Oak. Its like Bookers turned up to 13 in that the molasses is the first note out of the bottle. Theres a surprising lack ethanol here, despite the mammoth proof.  

**Taste:** Intensely sweet in a good way. Vanilla and cream, molasses and brown sugar that gives way to deep wood and oak notes. Theres some subtle dark chocolate. Its hot on the tongue, not as much as I expected but its still a hot dram. Not surprising. 

**Finish:** Long, and hot but filled with oaky vanilla and that cream note is back. This disappears to oak and chocolate, spice and leather. 

**Overall:** Impressively complex and rich. Unfortunately difficult to get. Very enjoyable. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 9**
