**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** Fine Wine and Spirits

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Hot, beam funky, maple. Peanut brittle, and caramel out the wazoo. Sweet and funky.   

**Taste:** Hot and sweet. Loads of beam peanut brittle and a generous helping of molasses and clove. Some dusty, leathery balance but mostly hot and sweet. The funk seems a tad reigned in here, though, compared to the regular off the shelf reserve.       

**Finish:** Long but hot. Rough but fades well - good balance of some pepper emerging and the consistent caramel sweetness of the dram.     

**Overall:** This is definitely a step up from the regular off-the-shelf Single Barrel Reserve and the palate of the picker shows itself to be favorable. This seemed more balanced, less hot and showed a little more complexity in balancing that beam peanut brittle funk I pick up with the sweet and the pepper. For this, Im giving this particular store pick a Rank 6 rating. This is certainly a cut above standard drams but Im not so certain Id be sold on multiple picks. Here at this Rank, Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve Fine Wines store pick sits with other high octane drams like Eagle Rare 10 and some younger SAOS Bourbon store picks.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
