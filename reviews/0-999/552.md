[**Review #552 | Bourbon Review #308 - Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend Prav Saraff Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-552-joseph-magnus-cigar-blend-prav-pick/)

**The Schtick:** This is yet another MGP sourced product. Blend of 11 and 18yr old whiskeys finished in Armagnac, Sherry and Cognac casks. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Joseph A Magnus Co

**Selection:** Prav Saraff

**ABV:** 50.35% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet cinnamon, vanilla, fig and date fruit. Very sweet honey, cinnabon icing, clove and faint tobacco. 

**Taste:** Medium thickness, no heat. Faint oakiness, pepper, tobacco and clove are very prominent. Very little fruit here, but there is noticeable vanilla character also. 

**Finish:** Medium, oaky, spicy pepper, lots of oaky bitterness. 

**Overall:** I think in trying to make a blend to pair with a cigar, they ended up with a blend that tastes like a cigar, but not in an especially positive way. Its too oaky, bitter and tannic for my tastes to really proclaim its greatness but it is a fairly solid sourced MGP cask. Not terrible, also not great.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
