[**Review #745 | France Review #26 - Uberach Single Cask Vert (Green)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-745-uberach-single-cask-vert-green/)

**The Schtick:** This is a green label (vert) release from Uberach which is distilled at Bertrand in Frnace. 

-----

**Distiller:** Bertrand

**Bottler:** Uberach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.4% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet and musty. Really prominent brandy notes - rich fruits, earthy, musty, caramel and pepper.  

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, musty and young. Fruity strawberries, figs, jammy apricot. Pepper, oak, young craft notes.  

**Finish:** Medium length, really musty and sweet - with some peppery, perfume-y essence. 

**Overall:** This is good, but definitely a bit rough and young. More age will likely smooth out the wrinkles, although proof did help it a bit. Its definitely a bit young for my tastes compared to the X. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
