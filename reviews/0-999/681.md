**The Schtick:** This is High Wests Double Rye expression that has spent 1 year and 5 months being finished in a Boulevardier barrel.

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** High West 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.6% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Really floral and fragrant. Peppery, leather, honey, vanilla and caramel. Very aromatic and sweet, deeply fruity. Very reminiscent of a Boulevardier cocktail. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouthfeel. Really prominent rye character, and also really prominent ethanol. Sweet, fruity and boldly spicy. Very much like a boulevardier with a side of rye. Theres some sweetness, but theres far more peppery, fruitiness.  

**Finish:** Short, overbearing cocktail influence. Sweet, some ethanol, good bit of honey. 

**Overall:** I didnt really like this, but I can see that some might. This was overbearing in the cocktail sense to me - tasted more like a rye forward pre-made boulevardier and less like rye with a nice cocktail finish. 

Thanks for reading!
