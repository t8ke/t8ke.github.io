[**Review #307 | Bourbon Review #174 - Makers Mark 46 Cask Strength Binnys Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-307-makers-mark-cs46-binnys-6/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Makers Mark

**Bottler:** Makers Mark

**Selection:** Binnys

**ABV:** 53.65% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Molasses. Mildly astringent. Honey, spicy pepper, big brown sugar.

**Taste:**  Metallic spice, maple, clove. Some minor minty dill (weird), lots of cinnamon. All of the Makers Ive had thus far has a weird splenda / metallic note to it and this is sadly no different. The heat is managed very well here though surprisingly. That might also be the red hot cinnamon masking, though.

**Finish:** Surprisingly long, which is nice, but its very hot. Hotter than the palate. Not terribly complex. Some odd splenda, metallic, red hots.

**Overall:** I think Ive learned that Makers just isnt for me. They dont make awful product but, at the same time, I think its just a profile that doesnt jive with me. The odd astringency, the cinnamon, and weird wood integration just doesnt make me pine to purchase products from their line. Im giving this a Rank 4. Its fine, and has no glaring flaws - just not the profile I love and it carried a hefty price to boot.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
