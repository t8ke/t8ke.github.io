It was aged in warehouse 9A. 

-----

**Distiller:** Laphroaig

**Bottler:** Laphroaig

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 59.8% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla cream, red berries. Big, brash smoke. Pepper, iodine, currants. Super vibrant pear, apples, lime and lemon zest with some dark cocoa and earth. Burning rubber at an all time high. 

**Taste:** Thick, rich, syrupy fruits. Really aggressive smoke - ash, burning rubber, bandaids. Toffee, buttered popcorn, caramel. Blackberry, some currant, lingonberry and tar. As the palate wears on the fruits give way to really brash smoke. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and smoky. Burning tar, ashy wood, more rubber here than bandaids. The sweet red fruits pop up a little before the ash consumes the rest of the finish. 

**Overall:** Really impressively made here. Its big, brash, rich and in your face. A really complex blend of vibrant fruit character and bold smoke and ash make this a Laphroaig for the ages. 

Thanks for reading!
