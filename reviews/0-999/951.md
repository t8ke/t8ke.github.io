**The Schtick:** Howdy, all. This is sort of a fun review thats near and dear to my heart. I make it a point to work on targeted blending, and spend a lot of time trying to understand how to generate blends that are both good, and on profile for certain projects. This was a tinker I worked on that I put in the "this could go so well, or so bad" category, and after marrying period, I realized I was quite fond of it. Ive been drinking through it over a couple months and wanted to give it a review. I dont intend to score it, because I dont think reviewing and scoring something I had a hand in solely picking or creating makes a lot of sense, additionally because it is not sold. I think its still valuable to talk about it, so I will remark more on what I learned and whether I think it was a success or a failure overall, rather than a concrete ranking.

-----

**Distiller:** Ardmore

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  63% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Caramel, buttered popcorn. Bread-y sweetness, with some yeast and dough, vanilla icing and confectioners sugar. Really rich stewed fruits, earthy pepper, bright and effervescent currants and tobacco. Very light soapstone, slate and charcoal.

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Restrained heat. Caramel, toffee, stewed fruits. Honey, apples and pears, cherries and currants, blackberry cobbler. Some mild smoke makes an entrance, playing nicely with the dessert notes and some chalky salinity. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and rich, but some heat here. A bit more smoke, pepper, tobacco. Seeing the fall of the fruit character here and a rise in smokey, woody, earthy notes. 

**Overall:** Overall, Im pleased with this product. There are some things I like and dislike, though. I am labeling this in the success category in my logs, and will likely try it again in a year or two. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: UNSCORED**
