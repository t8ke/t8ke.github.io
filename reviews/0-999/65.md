**The Schtick:** Smooth Ambler sourced rye from MGP/LDI in Indiana for a long while. This is a release of that bottling at cask strength.

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Smooth Ambler

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 56.6% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Buttery rye. Sweet nougat-y caramel and a little molasses. Theres some rye kick. 

**Taste:** Butter and caramel. Spice bomb right in the middle. Its prevalent but also well balanced. Theres chocolate and cloves, with some vanilla and molasses at the end.

**Finish:** Its long. Its spicy. It becomes sweet. I love it. Very rarely do I not add some water at some point when I m drinking a 100+ proof dram but this dram was complex and mellow. No water needed. Warming.

**Overall:** Phenomenal bottling of an excellent rye.  

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
