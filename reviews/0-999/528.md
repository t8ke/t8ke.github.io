**The Schtick:** Cameronbridge is one of the larger grain distilleries. It hails from the Lowlands region. This is a Douglas Laing IB of 25yr product from them. 

-----

**Distiller:** Cameronbridge

**Bottler:** Douglas Laings Old Particular

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:** 54.4% ABV

**Age:** 25 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, pear, vanilla, apples. Fruity, floral and perfumey. Bakery sweets like cake and doughnuts. Consistent fruitiness.  

**Taste:** Thin mouthfeel, sweet goney, faint brine, apples and pears are big here. Honey, faint tobacco and sulfur, hint of sherry type notes (PX)

**Finish:** Long, sweet, faint honey. 

**Overall:** The nose and finish here were great but the palate was sort of all over the place. Certainly not bad, as Ive found many well aged grain whiskeys to be perfectly fine, and this continue that trend. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
