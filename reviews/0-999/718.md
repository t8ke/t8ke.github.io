**The Schtick:** This is a limited edition release from Johnnie Walker (Diageo) alongside the release of Denis Villeneuves work of art: BladeRunner 2049. Shortly after being laid off in December, a couple friends of mine pooled together than purchased this as a gift for me. Ive drank it through many viewings of the movie, interviews, job hunting and shortly thereafter, when I accepted a new job. Ive finished off the bottle a couple months later and compiled my notes for a review. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Johnnie Walker

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  49% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, vanilla, dough, icing. Freshly baked bread. Some salt and pepper. Faint melon. Faint wisps of smoke.  

**Taste:** Medium mout hfeel, very minimal heat. Rich honey, vanilla, smoldering ash and pepper. Cocoa, some toffee and a nice oak presence. The smoke grows with time. 

**Finish:** Long, smoky and sweet. There is a lot of vanilla, toffee, icing, faint lemon and some nice smoke. 

**Overall:** The bump in proof seems to really benefit this expression. I dont know what other differences exist between this and the stock 12yr black label, but the presence of graininess is very much minimized and replaced with a richer mouth feel, longer finish and a much better integrated smoke presence.  

Thanks for reading!
