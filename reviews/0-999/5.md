**The Schtick:** This is a 100pf OBSV recipe release that sits on shelves next to Four Roses Small Batch and Yellow Label. Here in Wisconsin, it can be had for around $35-$40. 

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, floral sweetness with a nice spicy note after a deep whiff. Its all really well blended, very pleasant. 

**Taste:** Butter, sugar and a nice rye kick. Theres some caramel, cloves and rich maple. 

**Finish:** Surprisingly long and consistent, lots of butter and a little rye spiciness following through. Its sweet and spicy, with the bourbon notes and higher rye playing well off of one and another. 

**Overall:** This is a great budget bottle that exhibits top shelf flavor at mid shelf price. I dont take price into account for reviews, but this is really a winner and theres a reason its a well recommended gateway product. 

Thanks for reading!
