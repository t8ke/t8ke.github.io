[**Review #2 | Bourbon Review #2 - Smooth Ambler Old Scout 10yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-2-smooth-ambler-old-scout-10-year/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Smooth Ambler

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Very sweet, lots of vanilla, sugar, ice cream cone type cookie notes. Cinnamon and a little oaky clove, but very much a leaner into the sweet category. A lot of corn syrupy notes here which I think is the culprit.

**Taste:** Sugar and maple. Originally, I thought the proof was overpowering but that was definitely my virgin palate. Sweet and sugary, almost vegetal and corn heavy. Its complex but leans towards the sweet side with a lot less oak influence than expected for the age.

**Finish:** Medium but complex and relatively gentle. The proof is there but its not punishing. Just a nice sweet departure (literally)

**Overall:** This is a fine dram, especially at the price. Although Im not taking price into account, its worth noting that this is a great value since it can be had for $45 or so where Im from. Its no bargain like the Eagle, but its still very reasonable. The flavors are strong and complex and there arent any major flaws to speak of. For that, Ill give this a Rank 6.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
