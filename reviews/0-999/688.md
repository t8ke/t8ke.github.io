**The Schtick:** This is a gin released by Joseph A Magnus in the tri-state area. 

-----

**Distiller:** Joseph A Magnus

**Bottler:** Joseph A Magnus

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Very light, and effervescent. Citrus, white pepper, coriander and a strange note, almost like fennel. Overall, its more floral than fruity, with subdued juniper. Definitely not classic dry style. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Faintly bitter, with some subdued heat. Super floral here as the nose would have suggested. Waxy fruits here, white pepper and a nice herbal tone.

**Finish:** Short and super light. Very effervescent here also.

**Overall:** Overall, this wasnt my favorite neat, but it stood up very well in a citrus based gin cocktail.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
