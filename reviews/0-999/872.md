[**Review #872 | Scotch Review #293 - The Macallan Edition 3**]( https://t8ke.review/review-872-the-macallan-edition-no-3/)

**The Schtick:** This is The Macallans third release in their Edition line of expressions.

-----

**Distiller:** Macallan

**Bottler:** Macallan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 48.3% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Very fruity compared to the first two edition, so far. Vanilla cream, apples, pears, stewed fruits but more effervescent. Less tobacco here, very little oak. 

**Taste:** Sulfur, sweet vanilla. Some caramel and toffee. Oak reappears, light pepper, some faint tobacco. Mild astringency, but nothing like Edition 1. Overall its nice and sweet, mostly caramel and toffee, with faint sherry and a mild oak body. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet, but peppery. Some heat here. Oak reappears. Feels a little disjointed, but not fatally so. Admittedly a very rich finish. 

**Overall:** I liked this as much as Edition 2, and a hair more than Edition 1. There was a little astringency in the palate, but the nose was really quite nice. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
