[**Review #282 | Scotch Review #282 - Compass Box 3yr Deluxe**]( https://t8ke.review/review-282-compass-box-3yr-deluxe/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Compass Box

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 49.2% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Yeasty dough, cream, lemon peel, salted caramel, apples, white grape.

**Taste:** Sweet, floral, creamy grapes and pears. Very complex, more salted caramel, waxy lemon peel and cream.

**Finish:** Lightly peaty, rubbery. Sweet and ashy. Mild complexity here with medium length. That beautiful creamy waxy fruit and lemon peel is fantastic. This is really quite good.

**Overall:** Im rating this a Rank 8. Its really very good and the complexity is great. Its without a doubt old Clynelish in my mind and that is my jam as of late. I love the profile and the finish is pretty good too. That being said, while this is a great bottle, its over priced. Which explains why I have a sample of this and not the entire thing.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
