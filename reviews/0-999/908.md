**The Schtick:** This is a single barrel of Wild Turkeys Russells Reserve bourbon that was selected by Barrels and Brews. 

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** Barrels and Brews

**ABV:**  55% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, clove, peanut brittle, waffle cone and pepper. Sweet, musty, nutty. Not too spicy.   

**Taste:** Medium - very sweet. Not a ton of heat here. Caramel, nougat, honey. Some pepper and clove. Younger tasting, but rich in sweet dessert notes. 

**Finish:** Really present heat here as well as a short mouth feel, but nice all the same. Sweet is giving way to peppery tobacco and heavy cloves as well as some oak. Overall, a very vibrant transition.  

**Overall:** I liked this, but not as much as some. The transition was very interesting to watch, though. Starting very subdued and sweet to vibrant and spicy was something not often seen. If not the best barrel, certainly not a boring one. Thoroughly enjoyed.  

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
