[**Review #40 | Bourbon Review #21 - Bookers Oven Buster (2015-04)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-40-bookers-2015-04-oven-buster/)

**The Schtick:** Bookers is a Beam/Suntory product that is released unfiltered and at casks strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 63.5% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Theres a lot of vanilla here, paired well with brown sugar and molasses. Theres a little oak, but mostly cinnamon and some buttery caramel assault the nose. The alcohol isnt massively overstated and it doesnt bite me in the face which Im surprised, and frankly, impressed with.

**Taste:** Pepper, leather and molasses. Some woody notes, along with a lot of vanilla and more buttery sweetness.

**Finish:** Longer than average. A bit hot, but not overly so for the proof. Lots of vanilla, brown sugar and maple. 

**Overall:** Really well behaved for the proof, Bookers Oven Buster is a great look that good bourbon doesnt have to be matured for absurdly long periods of time. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
