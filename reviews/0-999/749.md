[**Review #749 | Bourbon Review #414 - Starlight Single Barrel Bourbon Liquor Barn Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-749-starlight-single-barrel-1421-liquor-barn-selection/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 2 year old single barrel bourbon picked by Liquor Barn in Kentucky. 

-----

**Distiller:** Starlight

**Bottler:** Starlight

**Selection:** Liquor Barn

**ABV:** 54.6% ABV

**Age:** 2 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Ethanol, cinnamon, vanilla and honey. 

**Taste:** Thin and hot, loaded with caramel, wet cardboard and damp, musty grass. There is a good deal of corn presence as well. 

**Finish:** Short, really hot for the proof. Its peppery and pretty prominently craft with moist sawdust, wet cardboard and musty sweetness. 

**Overall:** This is the first product Ive had from Starlight, but it really needs some more time in the barrel. The youth is undeniable and the heat is aggressive.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
