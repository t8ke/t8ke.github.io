**The Schtick:** This comes from a 4-way blind send courtesy of /u/playingwithfire. He said hes send me 4 samples (Crown Hand Select, Crown Apple, Mystery, Mystery Rum- all blind), most of them garbage, and let me go from there. I took notes and here they are. I did the tasting and got the reveals on the Whiskey Network Discord Server and then wrote up the pertinent details for posting the review. Enjoy! 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Sunny Rudge Imports

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Overripe fruits, sweet sugar, faint cocoa, maple. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, no real heat. Nice fruits, like pineapple, plantain, papaya, some sugary presence. Lightly dosed.

**Finish:** Medium length, no real heat or astringency, faint rubber, nice plantain and guava. 

**Overall:** Guessing this is the mystery rum. Pretty certain of it. This is light, a hair sweet, but easy drinking. Seems like it would make a good Daquiri. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
