[**Review #280 | Bourbon Review #280 - Henry McKenna 10yr BiB Liquor Barn Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-280-henry-mckenna-bib-10yr-liquor-barn-pick/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** Liquor Barn

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Oaky vanilla, clove, maple. Very oaky, mildly bitter nose but in a good way.

**Taste:** Oaky but sweet, in a way that EC12 can only dream about. Vanilla, mild cocoa, honey and a nice bittering note that keeps the sweet notes in check.

**Finish:** Long finish with a great warming quality. Good for the proof. Grows sweeter with the oak here with a strong vanilla finish.

**Overall:** Darn, this is really good. Just like the original its very solid and walks the line between oaky and sweet with great precision. Its not an insane jump from the regular, I notice this a hair sweeter but Im going to score it the same. You cant go wrong with it but I wouldnt hunt it out or pay a huge markup for it. Youll only be getting novelty. This gets a Rank 7 from me.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
