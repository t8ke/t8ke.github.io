[**Review #404 | Bourbon Review #231 - Very Old Saint Nick (Lot 12)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-404-very-old-saint-nicke-lot-12/)

**The Schtick:** Originally Very Olde Saint Nick was a Bardstown distilled product produced for the export marked, predominantly headed to Japan. There are a variety of VOSN products out there, each about as mysterious as the next unless they sport an age statement. They fetch various prices, based on the secondarys flavor of the day, in the hip game of not only keeping up with, but destroying the Joneses.

**Bottler:** KBD

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Wet cardboard, sweet toffee, green grass. It smells really youthful and musty at the same time. Nice caramel note.  

**Taste:** Weird aquarium funk. Its "wet", green, and musty. Thin mouthfeel; Lots of caramel and vanilla make an entry though, along with some heavy oak notes. 

**Finish:** Short and a bit hot for 90pf. For something so funky and oak driven, I expected it to stick around longer. This is not the case. 

**Overall:** Overall, Im not sure why people really go nutsy for it, or spend more than $30 a bottle. Thats about what Id comfortably pay. Price isnt taken into the rating though, which gives this a Rank 4/10. It was funky, young and old at the same time, and very musty. The palate was sort of pleasing but the finish just whisped away. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
