**The Schtick:** This is a 15 year old armagnac that is distilled and bottled at Chateau de Pellehaut. This fits nicely into adding to a previous series I did, comprised of various Pellehauts through the ages. This will fit nicely on the younger end of the scale. 

-----

**Distiller:** Chateau de Pellehaut

**Bottler:** Chateau de Pellehaut

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 48.6% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years

**Nose:**  Sweet confectioners sugar, pears, apple pie. Clove, Dole fruit syrup. Faint clove. Musty sweetness.  

**Taste:** Thick, rich mouth feel. No heat. Caramel apple, sweet toffee. Rich milk chocolate. No sulfur, faint oak, no bitterness or astringency. 

**Finish:** Medium, some heat. Caramel, vanilla cream, honey, wafer cookies. Really nice.

**Overall:** Super solid, very enjoyable. I really loved the lack of bitter sulfur on the palate and it definitely let a solid caramel body shine through. Really well done. Strangely enough, I enjoyed this as much as their really old releases, and a bit better than the 2000 17yr release. Im really enamored by what theyre doing over there. Well done, boys. 

Thanks for reading!
