**The Schtick:** This is part of the single casks release from The GlenDronach. They are either finished or fully matured in various wine casks, and bottled at cask strength.

-----

**Distiller:** GlenDronach

**Bottler:** GlenDronach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  55% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Dark chocolate, really deep fig and date fruit notes. Lots of raisen, sherry wine sweetness. Almost smells like I would imagine a glass of PX reduction would smell like. Thick, sweet and inviting.

**Taste:** Oily mouth feel, tons of sherry and fig. Raisens and dates, with a bit of spice making its way forward. More chocolate, there is dark cocoa with some sweet custard and fudge notes to balance. This really is something special. 

**Finish:**  Long and thick. Not at all hot, despite the proof. Ive used the term sherry bomb before, but this blows all others away. This easily sits in the same realm, even surpassing, my 24yr Glenfarclas. I just cant get over how rich of a dram this is. 

**Overall:** This is delicious and Im glad to have had a taste. Id really be interested in trying some really old casks but that might have to hold as a dream for some day given the price. Overall, I loved this and it was truly rich and delicious while maintaining some good balance. 

Thanks for reading!
