[**Review #242 | Bourbon Review #133 - Jim Beam Signature Series Rare Spanish Brandy**]( https://t8ke.review/review-242-jim-beam-singature-rare-spanish-brandy/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet and winey, maple, vanilla, red fruits, cinnamon

**Taste:**   Thin mouth feel but not surprised for the low proof. Sweet and unoffensive, loaded with molasses, cinnamon, fruity jam, vanilla. I fail to taste the "rarity" of the brandy but I do get a good bit of brandy notes.

**Finish:**  Short to medium and no heat whatsoever. Fruity and sweet but balanced with some nice woody maple notes. Never thought Id say this of a young Beam product but I actually enjoy this

**Overall:**  Overall, this is a decent product for the price and one I quite enjoy as winter is approaching. Its great for that time you dont need a bruiser dram but want something that wont give you flashbacks to college dorms at a great price. I wont embellish it and say its a very good, or even great whiskey but its quite a bit better than I expected from it and I enjoy sitting down to a dram of this to warm up for the evening or to just sip on while Im doing housework or whatnot. For this reason, Im giving this a 5. Nothing to be ashamed of in the slightest. Id honestly probably take this over Rare Breed (my last review before this)

Thanks for reading!
