[**Review #138 | Bourbon Review #75 - Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (Batch 4)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-138-elijah-craig-barrel-proof-batch-4-re-review/)

**The Schtick:** This is a moderately elusive release from Elijah Craig, which is Heaven Hill distillate bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 66.2% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Ethanol and cherries. Honey and molasses and a weird Dr. Pepper / Cola note. Ive always wondered whether people truly got this note in whiskey but bam, here it is. Cherries are huge. 

**Taste:** Thick like Mrs. Butterworths goods. Oaky and vanilla heavy, its hot but that was expected. Molasses and more cherries, more cola and a big whallop of maple.

**Finish:** Long, and hot. Lots of rich flavor though. Every note from nose to palate is here and its just overpowering. In a good way.

**Overall:** Id hate to become wordy. We have people for that. Its excellent, its big, bold and pulls no punches. Hot, delicious and rich.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
