[**Review #9 | World Review #1 - Wiesers Uuahouua Single Malt 7 Year Sherry**]( https://t8ke.review/review-10-wieser-uuahouua/)

**The Schtick:** Ill be completely honest, this bottle was an impulse buy. I was out looking for a good sherry bomb (ended up with a bottle of ABunadh at the time this trip happened) and while I was poking around the scotch section, an employee came over and asked what I was interested in. He suggested this bottle, and for a mere $30, I thought, why not. 7 years in sherry didnt seem so awful and I was having guests that weekend so I knew if it was lacking, Id have plenty of guinea pigs, er, I mean guests to pawn it off on. This one is distilled in Austria. 

-----

**Distiller:** Wieser

**Bottler:** Wieser

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey and grain with a touch of sherry sweetness

**Taste:** Very thin mouthfeel with a lot of honey and ethanol. It feels younger and a lot of the other notes like sherry, vanilla and cinnamon get crushed under the watery honey. 

**Finish:** Short, not overly harsh, but very one dimensional.  

**Overall:** Its not great and its not terrible but this one certainly lacks a lot of dimensionality and complexity. Its very low ABV and general lack of character make it hard to suggest, even at the price point.  

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
