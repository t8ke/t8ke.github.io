[**Review #341 | Bourbon Review #341 - Single Cask Nation Westland 2 Year Old**]( https://t8ke.review/review-341-westland-single-cask-nation/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Westland

**Bottler:** Single Cask Nation

**Selection:** Single Cask Nation

**ABV:** 57.8% ABV

**Age:** 2 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Caramel, vanilla, some nutty funkiness, lots of ethanol.

**Taste:** This is definitely a bit younger - I get that "Green" notes here. Sweet caramel, some nutty funk, wet card board, some vanilla.

**Finish:** Short, but not too rough. Young notes but some nice sweetness there also.

**Overall:** This wasnt bad, but it didnt blow my socks off. Its definitely young, but it has a lot of potential. Id love to try this in 4 or 5 years again when their juice is older. Ill give this a Rank 5.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
