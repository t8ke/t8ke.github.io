[**Review #856 | Bourbon Review #456 - Boondocks Cask Strength American Whiskey**]( https://t8ke.review/review-856-boondocks-cask-strength-american-whiskey/)

**The Schtick:** This is a sourced whiskey that is aged in ex-bourbon barrels, hence the American Whiskey designation, rather than a bourbon designation. 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Royal Wine Corp | Boondocks Spirit Co

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 63.5% ABV

**Age:** 11 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Caramel, passion fruit. Honey, vanilla, waffle cone. Spirit-y, but not punishing. Some banana. Some oak. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Shockingly light, not a ton of heat. Vanilla, cream, faint oak, pepper. Burnt plastic, astringency. Some fruits. 

**Finish:** Medium length, but very hot. Bananas foster, vitamins, oak, pepper, cream.

**Overall:** I think the nose was the best part. I enjoyed the other parts but they were pretty astringent and thin, all things considered. That said, Ive had far worse on this journey. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
