**The Schtick:** Four Roses offers the ability for stores and societies to pick barrels from their specific recipes and have them bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** Eagle River

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Caramel, sawdust, tobacco, white pepper, vanilla, cocoa 

**Taste:** Medium, very mild heat. Sweet cream, butter, faint oak, some pepper, nice caramel and cocoa. Faint metallic note, but its very nuanced. Little spice. 

**Finish:** Medium length, sweet caramel, pepper, oak and fudge. No real heat here. Sweet and spicy on the way out. 

**Overall:** This pick was unique and interesting but nothing earth shattering. Absolutely still solid, though.

Thanks for reading!
