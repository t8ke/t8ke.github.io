**The Schtick:** This is another release in the Parkers Heritage Collection and it is a bourbon, finished in cognac barrels that is ten years old and bottled at 50% ABV. 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, caramel, rich oak. Earthy tobacco, sweet musty notes. Stewed fruits, a faint bit of allspice and really robust cocoa.  

**Taste:** Thick and rich mouthfeel, no real heat despite the slightly elevated proof. Vanilla, nougat, faintly stewed fruits and rich rich caramel. This is perhaps the richest bourbon that I have had, and the stewed fruits + nougat element adds massive character.

**Finish:** Long, rich, loaded with earthy tobacco, sweet caramel and vanilla, rich nougat and payday bar an the onset of some delicious stewed fruits. 

**Overall:** This is one of the best bourbons that I have had - it is diverse and complex, rich and full, and everything that I wish a bourbon could be. Sigh.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 9**
