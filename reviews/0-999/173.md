**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Bulleit

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Minty dill, plastic and sweets. Light maple with confectioners sugar. Its got some wood to it and a nice rye zip. Smelly like spicy tastes.

**Taste:** Ooh thats why...it is spicy. Thin mouth feel but sweet. Theres some of that spearmint I love so much and an obese helping of brown sugar. Yum. Theres a good deal of spicy rye with a full bodied clove note.

**Finish:** Medium with mild mint. For 90 proof, its got no ethanol to show for it and it goes down easy. Sweet artificial sugar, minty and rye spicy. Its good. Not absurdly good but I put it a hair ahead of Jim Beam Rye and the modern Ritt Rye releases.

**Overall:** Its a solid rye. We all love to hate Diageo but I can find this for $21 around me and thats a darn steal. At a hair under Jim Beam Rye and about the same for Ritt Rye, I think this is an easy winner.

Thanks for reading!
