[**Review #134 | Rye Review #72 - Rittenhouse Rye Bottled In Bond**]( https://t8ke.review/review-134-rittenhouse-rye-bib/)

**The Schtick:** This is the distilled at Heaven Hill edition of Ritt Rye.

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Rye and mild ethanol, caramel and spicy cinnamon notes. Some nice warm molasses too.

**Taste:** Spicier and a bit hotter. Mild metallic note. Lots of warm rye spice, vanilla and molasses. Still pretty delicious.

**Finish:**  Medium in duration but definitely spicier and hotter than the previous. Lots of sweet sweet molasses/vanilla, though.

**Overall:** Overall, and I hate to say it, but this is definitely different. Its a little rougher and hotter, which leads me to believe its maybe not quite as old. Its still delicious though, and I wouldnt turn it down. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
