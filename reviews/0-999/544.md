[**Review #544 | Scotch Review #194 - Glenallachie 11yr Hepburns**]( https://t8ke.review/review-544-koloa-rum-company-gold-rum/)

**The Schtick:** This is a golden rum from Kaloa Rum Company, distilled and bottled in Kalaheo, HI. 

-----

**Distiller:** Glenallachie

**Bottler:** Hepburns Choice

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 11 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Strong hit of ethanol; caramel and vanilla notes really shine. Faint pineapple, lime and orange peel. Butter pecan, very pleasant. 

**Taste:** Thin, but no heat or astringency. Sweet caramel, butter pecan and faintly floral notes are prominent. Vanilla butter cream is also a big component. 

**Finish:** Short, sweet and complex. Delicious oak, snickers bar, syrupy fruitiness. Some faint oaky bitterness.  

**Overall:** I really like this but the finish is a hair short. Nose is obscene though. In a good way. Oh man.  Palate good too, finish short though. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
