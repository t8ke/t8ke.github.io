**The Schtick:** This is supposedly (according to Balcones) the first whiskey on the market, produced in Texas, since Prohibition. It is made from heirloom blue corn. 

-----

**Distiller:** Balcones

**Bottler:** Balcones

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet rich cream. Nice vanilla. Muted corn. Not much else here. 

**Taste:** Corn, caramel, odd vitamin note. Some cocoa, light oak, pepper. Weird fruity notes. Thin, no real heat. Sort of musty. 

**Finish:** Short, no real heat here. Tastes like shredded wheat cereal, faint oak, some vanilla. 

**Overall:** This isnt terrible, the nose is the best part, though. From there its down hill. Im going to give this a 4, though. I really enjoyed the nose, the palate was good and the finish wasnt bad. Thats saying a lot here in Craft Whiskey Land

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
