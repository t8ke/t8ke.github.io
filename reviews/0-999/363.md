**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 63.1% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Mmmm. Spicy clove, gingerbread, hot buttery caramel. Brash, sweet, spicy. Smells like dessert and I can feel a stiff erection forming.

**Taste:** Theres some heat here but not punishing for the proof. Its rich, thick, the mouthfeel is nice and oily. Warm buttery caramel, toffee, pepper, clove. Its sweet, theres a hint of oak and some good vanilla and some faint cocoa. Then the peppery sweetness is back. Mmmmm its good.

**Finish:** Long, theres some heat here too but its pleasant. Rich notes from the palate continue and it slowly lingers away.

**Overall:** THH is my jam and I dont keep it a secret. I really like this release. It was sweeter, less abrasive and had some really nice peppery clove. The balance here was spot on. This is my deserted island rye and I wish I could buy it all of the time. Unfortunately, I cant.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
