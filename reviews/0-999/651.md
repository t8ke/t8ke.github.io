[**Review #651 | Bourbon Review #357 - Willett XCF**]( https://t8ke.review/review-651-willett-xcf-10/)

**The Schtick:** This is a weird Heimerdinger of a release from our pals down at Willett. The XCF stands for eXperimental Cask Finish, and this 7 year old bourbon spent 90 days being finished in a cask that once held Curacao. Lets see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Willett

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 51.7% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Allspice, clove and pepper. Faint citrus peel, perfumey, and musty. Some mustiness. Some cough syrupy notes. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouthfeel. Sweet honey, lots of allspice. Cloying citrus peel notes. Reminds me almost a little of Hochstadters Rock n Rye - but not as thick or cloying. Theres a lot of clove here, earthiness and bitter cocoa. 

**Finish:** Short, hot and packs a surprising amount of bitterness. Earthier than Id like, and loaded with artificial sweetener notes. 

**Overall:** This was interesting and super fun to try, but its definitely not for me.  

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
