**The Schtick:** This is a group pick Belle Meade bottling. It is bottled at cask strength and the base is sourced from MGP in Indiana. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Green Brier

**Selection:**  Hardpour Corn

**ABV:** 62.85% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Really prominent corn here. Toffee, peanut brittle, loaded with caramel. All sweet, no substantial oak presence here and its also pretty dormant on the pepper / tobacco front. This nose is really reminding me of a well aged Knob Creek Single Barrel store pick, but almost even a hair sweeter.  

**Taste:** Thick, rich mouthfeel. For the proof, the heat is mysteriously absent but the viscosity is bonkers. Sweet caramel, kettle corn, faintly funky in that MGP cocoa / oak / tobacco way. Really compliments well. The richness is really surprising. 

**Finish:** Long, mild heaet but still impressively rich. Lots of caramel, kettle corn and some nice cocoa as well. 

**Overall:** Overall, Ive generally found that Belle Meade picks are average to good. This was phenomenal. The richness and depth of flavors was really something. It was sweet and savory without being a bitter oak bomb and really jived with me. Digging the name, too. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
