**Nose:**  Sweet cream, stewed fruits, really prominent wine presence with some faint funkiness. Sweet, creamy, earthy, peppery, toffee. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, creamy and lots of toffee. Stewed fruits, pear, buttery chardonnay. Some toffee, caramel, molasses, rich earthiness. Tobacco, pepper, really earthy.  

**Finish:** Short, sweet cocoa, earthy and loaded with pepper and deep stone fruits like a nice Cabernet. 

**Overall:** Super interesting but all over the place. I enjoy looking back to see what the maturation blend is on these after reviewing and I cant say Im super surprised. This is all over the map. 

Thanks for reading!
