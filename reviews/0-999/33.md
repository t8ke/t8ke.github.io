**The Schtick:** This expression is the Flaming Heart 15th Edition which is a blend of some pretty impressive whiskeys clocking in at a total 48.9% ABV:

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Compass Box

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 48.9% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Theres some smoke with light light peat, followed by what seems to be pear and apple notes with some fruity vanilla. Theres a light honey sweetness as well. I like the blend of smoke and sweet and quite frankly its delicious. Good balance of both. 

**Taste:** Theres more vanilla on the tast ebuds than the nose but theres also more smoke. A little less fruit and a little less honey but the vanilla and smoke marry very well. Im impressed for a blend, but this is what CB does and I have to say they do it well. 

**Finish:** The finish is medium long with lots of smoke. Theres a little char too, I feel like Ive licked a campfire log but I dont dislike it. Its warming with a slight abrasiveness, but nothing too off putting.

**Overall:** Im a big fan. I havent spent a whole lot of time with blends this was something special. 

Thanks for reading!
