**The Schtick:** This is a sourced American whiskey that is coming to us from Indiana, Tennessee and Kentucky. It is aged in American oak and finished in bourbon, brandy, Amaro and Cognac casks. It is bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Barrell

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 59.2% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, caramel, confectioners sugar, corn and banana bread. Faint mineral notes, but mostly, it is a sweet candy like nose. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, only a little mild heat. Sugary, sweet caramel. Honey, roasted peanuts, almonds, corn syrup, cotton candy, confectioners sugar. Some faint oak. 

**Finish:** Short, hot and growing with some astringency. Lots more toffee, caramel and oak here. 

**Overall:** Overall, this is sort of a wild ride. Its all over the place, mostly super sweet, and introduces some really unique elements for an American whiskey. While I appreciate the innovation, I dont think its executed incredibly well, but the end product is enjoyable enough. 

Thanks for reading!
