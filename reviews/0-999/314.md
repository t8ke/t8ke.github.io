[**Review #314 | Bourbon Review #178 - Charbay III**]( https://t8ke.review/review-314-charbay-iii/)

**The Schtick:** Another insane product from Charbay, Small batch, huge price, yadda yadda...you know the drill.

-----

**Distiller:** Charbay

**Bottler:** Charbay

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 66.2% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Hops, toffee, stouty, hoppy and almost hempy nose. Huge hybrid of weed and boozy hops. A little fungal. No, a lot fungal.

**Taste:** Sweet, toffee, caramel, sugary. Funky, hoppy and vegetal. Thick oily mouthfeel, very pleasant for the proof. Syrupy.

**Finish:** Long and complex. Vegetal, sweet, really funky

**Overall:** This is also insanely unique. Unlike the BC pick, this is definitely more funky, hempy, vegetal, way out in left field strange. I like it though, and I think that, while, it cant compete with the Bourbon Crusaders pick, its still very good product. Delicious. Unique. Im going to give it a Rank 8

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
