**The Schtick:** This is a mystery sample that was sent to me. I have filled in all of the details, post-reveal. The image here is obviously not accurate to the date. 

-----

**Distiller:** Old Overholt

**Bottler:** Old Overholt

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 4 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, caramel, clove. Very fruity, nice tobacco and toffee.  

**Taste:** Medium thickness, no heat. Super fruity. Lots of toffee, rye, very Canadian like. Candy notes, and some faint mint. More fruit and some clove. Really reminiscent of Whistle Pig here. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet. No heat once again. Rye spice, clove, honey, melon and lots more fruitiness. 

**Overall:** Overall: Old Overholt 86pf from 1986. Interesting. Im glad I got that it was rye, but it was super fruity, and that threw me for one real big loop. Pretty good stuff!

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
