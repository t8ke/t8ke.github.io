**The Schtick:** "Known for producing fruit spirits since 1874 Bertrand distillery offers a product of great originality: The Biersky! 

-----

**Distiller:** Bertrand

**Bottler:** Uberach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 44.4% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Honey, doughy and bready. Musty and sticky sweet pastries. Like a nice, rich raisin bread. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel. Oily, sticky caramel and cinnabon notes. Icing, mild sulfur, honey caramel and vanilla. Light pepper. Reminds me faintly of Charbay characteristics like the III. Musty, funky, tasty dessert. 

**Finish:** Medium length, dought and sweet with plums, tobacco and vanilla. 

**Overall:** Super unique but showing a lot of complexity for something with as strange a mashbill as this. I thought this improved on a lot of flaws I found in Charbay R5 - not to say this is a direct comparison, by any means, but the sample pool of products like this that Ive tried is very low. The complexity and the blend of sweet to funk makes this a good pick in my book.

Thanks for reading!
