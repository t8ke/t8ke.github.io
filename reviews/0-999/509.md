[**Review #509 | Bourbon Review #291 - Corsair Triple Smoke**]( https://t8ke.review/review-509-corsair-triple-smoke/)

**The Schtick:** This is a frankenwhiskey produced from a variety of smoked grains. The bottle sports a poor attempt at replicating a Reservoir Dogs theme.

-----

**Distiller:** Corsair

**Bottler:** Corsair

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet, funky, smoky. Sugary vanilla, confectioners sugar, liquid smoke. Meaty. 

**Taste:** Thin, cloyingly sweet. Honey, sugar, grains. Maple, more liquid smoke. Not as ashy as Brimstone. 

**Finish:** Short, again cloyingly sweet and faintly smoky. 

**Overall:** Its thin, too sweet in a cloying way and the smoke tastes fake. Thats about the best I can say of this product. Why are all my garbage whiskey reviews bunching together? I want off this train. Someone save me. Please. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 2**
