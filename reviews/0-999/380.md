[**Review #380 | Rum Review #380 - Papas Pilar 24 Rum**]( https://t8ke.review/review-380-papas-pilar-24/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Pilar

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Thick, rich maple syrup. Brown sugar. Light rum funk - sweet, earthy, only very mildly meaty. Nose smells like a nice stack of pancakes.

**Taste:** No heat, but for 80pf thats not really any kind of surprise. Pleasant mouthfeel, but a a little thin. Very sweet and very maple, brown sugar, vanilla, caramel forward. Thats pretty much all of the notes here.

**Finish:** Medium in length, still sweet and mild. Really get the illusion of a stack of pancakes as this fades away.

**Overall:** Overall, this is a very unique product. It almost falls into "one trick pony" classification. Its sweet, maple bound and molasses forward and theres not much more. That doesnt make it bad, it just makes it slightly less versatile. I drank this far faster than I expected but I only reached for it when it was exactly what I wanted. Overall, I enjoyed it and the price of acquisition was pretty good too - it can be found easily under $40. Distribution isnt great, though. At the end of the day, its a nice departure from hugely funky, meaty boutique rums if youre looking for something unique.

Thanks for reading!
