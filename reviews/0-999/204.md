[**Review #204 | Bourbon Review #114 - Barton 1792 Full Proof**]( https://t8ke.review/review-204-1792-full-proof/)

**The Schtick:** This is Bartons 1792 line of bourbons and this is their 2016 "maybe sorta a little limited but we hope people go full LE fever over this release" bourbon. 

-----

**Distiller:** Barton

**Bottler:** Barton

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 61.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Caramel, dough, spicy clove. Mildly vegetal but mostly funky and corn heavy sweetness. Some thick caramel. Musty notes. 

**Taste:** Sweet and fruity - lots of banana and toffee and caramel. Young roughness - some strawberry and a whop of burn. Its hot, even for its proof and although a load of more caramel comes in to see it off, I cant help but hope for the finish to save this dram. 

**Finish:**  Long and very sweet, particularly in the fruity caramel dimension. Also very hot. Im not sure if this is a hot mess or not but it really isnt quite as good as the nose was leading me to believe. 

**Overall:** I wanted to like this but just like all of the other 1792 releases Ive had (including their core small batch) have left me thinking 1792 could have just done a little better. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
