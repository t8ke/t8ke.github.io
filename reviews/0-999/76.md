**Nose:**  Vanilla, theres some solid cinnamon and....banana bread?      

**Taste:** Rich vanilla with a mild spice kick. Its a little hot, but not unreasonably so. Banana is back though. I cant tell if theres malty sweetness that makes me think of sweet bread or if theres truly banana. 

**Finish:** Okay yeah its banana. I never really expected this but it doesnt put me off too much. The finish is short but well blended and leaves gently with some more vanilla and banana bread notes.  

**Overall:** For what it costs, its good. Not OGD good, but not bad at all.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
