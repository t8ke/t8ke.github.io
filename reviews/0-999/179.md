[**Review #179 | Bourbon Review #97 - Old Grand Dad National Distillers**]( https://t8ke.review/review-179-old-grand-dad-nd-1998-re-review/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** National Distillers

**Bottler:** Beam/Suntory

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Light caramel, buttery sweet and no peanut funk. Lots of toffee and butterscotch. Its sweet and I like that a lot.  

**Taste:** Light and sweet, no ethanol. Lots of caramel with a mild floral undertone.   

**Finish:** Short but sweet and not rough at all. Im really impressed at the complexity and well blended-ness (is that a word? Now it is.) of these older bottlings.   

**Overall:** It is certainly different than current OGD86 and I like it. Sweet and simple, these older bottlings seem to be more one dimensional in profile but what they do, they do very well. Again, Im impressed and I certainly see the appeal now of hunting these fellas down. For the quality exhibited here, Im giving the Old Grand Dad from 1998 a rating of a 6: a cut above. OGD1998 sits handily next to other classic BIBs in the bracket, sharing a row with the likes of Very Old Barton Bottled in Bond, Heaven Hill Bottled in Bond and Wild Turkey 101. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
