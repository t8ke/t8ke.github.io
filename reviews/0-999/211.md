[**Review #211 | Bourbon Review #120 - John E. Fitzgerald Larceny **]( https://t8ke.review/review-211-larceny/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet and yeasty. Very creamy nose and smells very sweet. Theres some mild caramel, thin brown sugar and a hint of buttercream. Mild ethanol that fades quickly with time.

**Taste:** Very sweet with a medium mouth feel. No heat despite the mildly elevated proof. I like the forward fruitiness and caramel here with some vanilla - although a little oak or clove would really balance nicely.

**Finish:**  Theres a little bitterness here and a tad bit of funk. This is the first time it is appearing but its not vile or overarching. Sweet honey here, more cream, mild clove and a healthy dose of caramel makes for one sweet, mild mannered dram.

**Overall:** A lot of people like to hate on Larceny and Im not sure why. To me, this is a better Makers Mark - especially given that its about $10 (or more, at times) cheaper here. It has the same mild, sweet wheat profile as other wheaters and delivers well on the proof. I wouldnt pick this every day but for the price and the quality, it can live on my shelf as a nice and sweet mellow dram. For this reason, Im rating Larceny a Rank 5. It doesnt shine above big gun bottles but for $18 its perfectly fine and shines at the price. Id take this over OWA any day of the week. Which is nice, because I can find it.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
