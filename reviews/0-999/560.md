**The Schtick:** This is a 9yr single barrel MGP cask picked and bottled at cask strength by Nelson Greenbrier Distillery in Nashville, TN under the Belle Meade label. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Green Brier

**Selection:** VA State

**ABV:** 53.35% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Big bold maple, molasses and allspice. MGP bourbon, if Ive ever tasted it.

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel with fairly tame heat. All spice is prominent with some caramel, cocoa, clove and vanilla. 

**Finish:** Medium length with growing spice. Reminds me of a blend of BT and WT101.

**Overall:** Overall this is good but so generically bourbon that Im going to give it a 5. Definitely good, but also not really notable in any respect. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
