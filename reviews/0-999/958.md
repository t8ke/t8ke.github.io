[**Review #958 | Bourbon Review #500 - Buffalo Trace Antique Collection: George T. Stagg 2017**]( https://t8ke.review/review-958-buffalo-trace-antique-collection-george-t-stagg-2017/)

**The Schtick:** This is a well aged, cask strength bourbon that exists as part of the exclusive set of Antique Collection releases that drop from Buffalo Trace every fall. This is a 15 year old bourbon, released as a marriage of 309 barrels that were hand picked by Buffalo Trace staff. As we draw upon the fall hunt season, I found myself finishing this bottle from last years release and figured that Bourbon review #500 made for a good case to finish off the bottle, and my note taking.

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 64.6% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich oak, cherry, prune and plumb. Pepper, tobacco, super rich musty sweetness. Vanilla, toffee, thick, rich cocoa. Im really surprised by how deep, fruity and rich the nose is.  

**Taste:** Thick mouth feel. Mild heat. Lots of cocoa, pipe tobacco and clove. Good oaky body, nice structure without being too dry. Lots of cherry, toffee, some passion fruit. Almost like a cherry cordial. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and oaky. Not too much oak here, but just enough to give it a good deal of complexity. Cherry, vanilla and cocoa are also present, with a long tobacco note to close out the dram.

**Overall:** This vintage of George T Stagg wasnt heralded as one of the greats, but I found that I really loved it all the same. The massive fruity body with a compelling oak presence combined with decadent cocoa and pipe tobacco made this a winner for me, and a bottle I enjoyed from first to last. 

Thanks for reading!
