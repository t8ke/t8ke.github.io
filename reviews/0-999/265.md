[**Review #265 | Bourbon Review #145 - Smooth Ambler American Whiskey**]( https://t8ke.review/review-265-smooth-ambler-american-whiskey/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Smooth Ambler

**Bottler:** Smooth Ambler

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 49.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Corn syrup, sweet vanilla, creamy clove, cinnamon. Really very corn heavy and it smells like a young spirit.

**Taste:** Mild and sweet. Its a bit hot, with lots of corn followed by nuances of vanilla and caramel.

**Finish:** Short, harsh. It grows astringent and hot. Theres a bit of spiciest also, but I cant differentiate whether or not its spice or just the astringency blending in.

**Overall:** I like what they are doing here but it needs a great deal more work. Its young and it shows. Im not losing hope though and I hope that in another year or two, maybe more, their own distillate shines in ways that surpass their scouted MGP barrels now. Im giving this a Rank 4 - its good but there are flaws. I have to give SA a lot of credit though - they know what theyre doing and they know how to price their experiments. Retail for this is $35-$40 and it seems they have reasonable expectations that are in check.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
