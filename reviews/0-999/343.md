[**Review #343 | Bourbon Review #343 - Willett Family Estate 4yr Bourbon**]( https://t8ke.review/review-343-willett-family-estate-4yr-bourbon/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** WIllett

**Bottler:** Willett

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 58.2% ABV

**Age:** 4 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet corn, caramel, toffee, vanilla

**Taste:** Rich mouthfeel, some mild youth (wet cardboard), sweet vanilla, cream, toffee. Still definitely young, but has really strong potential.

**Finish:** Long, complex but sweet. Heat is very well managed

**Overall:** Im very impressed by this - it is definitely young and could use some more time - it has that "Green" wet cardboard note I get from a lot of young distillate. That being said, its sweet, buttery and complex for what it is and I"m very glad I was able to try it. The proof is on point and I really like the mouth feel. Im not sold on WIlletts distillate yet, but this is a very confident move in the right direction for them. Im excited to see where it goes. Ill give this a Rank 6.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
