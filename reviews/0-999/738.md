-----

**Distiller:** Foursquare

**Bottler:** Foursquare 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 11 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, molasses, stewed fruits, brown sugar and white grape juice. Sweet, dessert-y and lightly fruity. 

**Taste:** Think mouthfeel but sweet. Lots of fruits here, especially pears, melon and some berries. Tobacco, confectioners sugar and some mild heat rounds out the experience.

**Finish:** Short, melon forward and loaded with honey, pepper and faint tobacco. 

**Overall:** I liked this, but felt it suffered a bit in the palate. It felt a bit thin, and there was some mild heat that didnt really belong given the low proof. That said, I enjoyed this, but it definitely left a lot of potential on the table.  

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
