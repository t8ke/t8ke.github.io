**The Schtick:** This is a private group selection, done through Single Cask Nation, that chose a barrel from MGP. It is 11 years old and is bottled at Cask Strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Single Cask Nation

**Selection:** C+S Straight Up

**ABV:** 52.6% ABV

**Age:** 11 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, caramel and a load of butterscotch. Tobacco, earthy pepper, allspice. Very signature MGP profile. Very delicious smelling. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, no real heat. Grows a bit richer with time. Faint Dole fruit cocktail syrup. Pepper, vanilla, lots of nice tobacco and some butter cream. Creme brulee. The balance between earthy, spicy and sweet and rich is really striking. 

**Finish:** Long, grows faintly drying with really restrained heat. Vanilla and loads of pepper corns and a faint fruitiness. 

**Overall:** This is really well done. Im typically not a lover of the MGP profile, but this has a lot of depth and blends just right. Im a fan. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
