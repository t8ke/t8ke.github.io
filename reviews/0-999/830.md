**The Schtick:** This is a 25 year old, cask strength armagnac coming to us using an interesting recipe - a significant quantity of the distillate is made using Folle Blanche grapes. Since Brut de Fut means cask strength in French, its a bit redundant to note this but the 42.4% ABV is indeed cask strength.

**Nose:**  Super honey forward. Floral, sweet fruits like melon, apples, pears, raspberry. Smells like a nice ice wine. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No heat. Sweet honey, clove, mild sulfur, apple pie, light clove. Very syrupy flavor, with some nice vanilla undertones. 

**Finish:** Short, no real heat. Clove, sulfur, tobacco blends really nicely with apple, syrupy pear, some faint pear and confectioners sugar. 

**Overall:** Overall, I liked this but almost found it too sweet. The fruitiness and sugary notes dominated what little spice there was. If you like a real sweet brandy, this is for you. 

Thanks for reading!
