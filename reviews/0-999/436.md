**The Schtick:** This rum spends 8 years in ex-bourbon and is then finished for 4 years in wild cherry casks. Theres not a lot of info on this release and its certainly not easy to find. I believe there is something to do with Ferrand casks, if thats a thing? The relevant parts of the internet for this are scarce, and in foreign languages that dont want to translate well.

**Distiller:** Plantation

**Bottler:** Plantation

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 44.1% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years

**Nose:**   Sweet maple and sugar, overripe fruits like banana, guava and mango. Theres faint cherry notes here, but nothing super bold. 

**Taste:** Thin but not astringent. Pleasantly fruity and sweet with lots of maple, strewed fruits and bright strawberry notes. 

**Finish:** Medium length and pleasantly sweet. Not cloying at all and some nice oakiness balances the sweet fruits very well. Not super funky, and there are lots of fruits that seem natural and not at all syrupy. 

**Overall:** I really enjoy this. I dont know what it costs but if I could find it, Id snag one if I could afford it. I think it would make a really unique daquiri with some lime and simple and its also delightful neat. 

Thanks for reading!
