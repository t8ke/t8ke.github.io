[**Review #479 | Rum Review #8 - Doorlys Barbados Rum 12yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-489-doorlys-12yr-barbados-rum/)

**The Schtick:** This is rum sourced from Foursquare in Barbados and sold through Total Wine and More in the USA. Carrying a modest price tag and a reasonable age statement, I was intrigued when I stumbled across a bottle on sale. 

-----

**Distiller:** Foursquare 

**Bottler:** Doorlys

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet caramel, underripe melon, overripe banana. Oak, confectioners sugar, molasses. 

**Taste:** Thin mouthfeel but sweet with no ethanol presence. It is oaky and sweet with some faint ester funkiness. Nicely balanced between molasses, maple, esters and some oakiness. This is distinctly rum but it has some really nice bourbon character. 

**Finish:** Medium length, mildly astringent but not too bad. Sweet and oaky with one last hint of nice tropical fruits. 

**Overall:** Overall, this is a fairly decent rum. Price isnt accounted for in rating, but Im glad I picked up a bottle. It isnt the best rum in the world, but its also certainly a far cry from the worst. For $16.99 for the bottle, I am more than satisfied. Overall, the offering here was a nice light rum with good character and some nice bourbon influence also. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
