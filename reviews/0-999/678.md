**The Schtick:** This comes from a 4-way blind send courtesy of /u/playingwithfire. He said hes send me 4 samples (Crown Hand Select, Crown Apple, Mystery Mystery - all blind), most of them garbage, and let me go from there. I took notes and here they are. I did the tasting and got the reveals on the Whiskey Network Discord Server and then wrote up the pertinent details for posting the review. Enjoy! 

-----

**Distiller:** Crown Royal

**Bottler:** Crown Royal

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  35% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Green jolly rancher, fake sugar, overwhelmingly fake - green tootsie pop. The nose is highly effervescent - my whole living room now smells like Ranchers. 

**Taste:** Thick, syrupy, rich but artificially sweet. No burn, sugar, fake apple. Disgustingly thick.

**Finish:** None. Apples. No heat, very short. 

**Overall:** For what it is (an underproofed, heavily dosed and sweetened artificial whiskey based flavored liqueur) it isnt the worst thing Ive ever had. I dont know what this could mix with to be pleasant, though. As a whiskey, this is horrid. It has to be Crown Apple. 

Thanks for reading!
