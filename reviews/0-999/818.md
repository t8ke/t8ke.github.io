[**Review #818 | Rum Review #32 - Appleton Estate 21yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-818-appleton-estate-21yr-rum/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 21 year old, minimum age stated, Jamaican rum from Appleton Estate. It has been colored. I tasted this blind, knowing that it was a rum product, and the brand was revealed to me after I took down notes and assigned a score. For more blind shenanigans, check out the Whiskey Network Discord, which has expanded nicely into just about any spirits category there is.

**Distiller:** Appleton Estate

**Bottler:** Appleton Estate

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 21 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, tobacco, cotton candy, tangerine. Really strange, but interesting.  

**Taste:** Thin, funky, ripe banana, pepper, orange, brown sugar

**Finish:** Medium length, sweet maple, honey and orange. Clove, brown sugar.

**Overall:** Nice, but still a bit thin in the palate. Im really surprised at how thin this was overall, given the age, but then again - age is just one small part of releasing a great spirit. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
