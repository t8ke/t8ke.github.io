[**Review #753 | Scotch Review #252 - The Glenlivet Founders Reserve**]( https://t8ke.review/review-753-the-glenlivet-founders-reserve/)

**The Schtick:** This is a NAS expression from The Glenlivet that features a small portion of single malt that has been matured in first fill American oak. It is artificially colored. 

-----

**Distiller:** Glenlivet

**Bottler:** Glenlivet

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Apples, honey, vanilla, light caramel, very faint oak. 

**Taste:** Thin, no heat. Not super bold - light and prominently features apples, faint leather, honey, some astringency and vanilla.

**Finish:** Short, mostly vanilla and apple here. Some faint bitterness.

**Overall:** Not super complex, but there were some characteristics I didnt super enjoy. Astringency in the palate, while light, was disappointing given the proof. Faint bitterness in the finish was also undesirable as well. That said, though, this is a nice light dram that doesnt require much thought and seems well suited for the warmer weather Wisconsin has been plagued with lately.

Thanks for reading!
