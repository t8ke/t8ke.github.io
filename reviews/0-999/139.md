[**Review #139 | Bourbon Review #76 - Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (Batch 5)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-139-elijah-craig-barrel-proof-batch-5-re-review/)

**The Schtick:** This is a moderately elusive release from Elijah Craig, which is Heaven Hill distillate bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 67.4% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  More cherry and molasses here and more Dr. Pepper. Less oak and vanilla. Bit more ethanol too.

**Taste:** This is a good deal hotter. I notice more molasses and cherry here as well and its still delicious. More burn but also a tad more flavor. A hint of dark chocolate and cocoa with a tiny bit of vanilla. Yum.

**Finish:** Still long. Still hot. Still massive. Punchy and rich, loads of cherry and cola here. 

**Overall:** Not slowing down, not decreasing in quality. A little less of what I love compared to #4, but only slightly so and still excellent. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
