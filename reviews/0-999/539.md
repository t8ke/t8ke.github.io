[**Review #539 | Bourbon Review #303 - Stagg Jr. Batch 8**]( https://t8ke.review/review-539-stagg-jr-batch-8-1295/)

**The Schtick:** This is a Buffalo Trace Mashbill 1 product that is aged "around 10 years" and bottled at cask strength. It typically releases widely, twice annualy. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 64.75% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Brown sugar, maple, chocolate covered cherries and orange zest. Oak, cinnamon, toffee. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel but pretty bold flavor. Good amount of heat. Fruity, sweet. Definitely mashbill one. Theres that faint BT passion fruit, mango, cherry, orange zest, followed by caramel, sweet confectioners sugar and a whole lot of sweet cocoa and oak. 

**Finish:** Long, all sweet. Wonderfully complex and loaded with sugars, maple, cocoa and a faint wisp of oak. 

**Overall:** Im glad to see that this has been a consistently good product since about Batch 3/4. Everyone since then has had their heat and astringency in check while packing a very comparable flavor profile. This is no different and I enjoyed it very much, as a result.

Thanks for reading!
