[**Review #68 | Bourbon Review #38 - Stagg Jr. Batch 2**]( https://t8ke.review/review-68-stagg-jr-batch-2/)

**The Schtick:** Stagg Jr is made from the same mashbill as the Buffalo Trace Antique Collections George T. Stagg product. This is aged "almost ten years" per the label and is bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 64.35% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  More ethanol in the nose. More vanilla. A bit less cinnamon but this mirrors my expectations for what I thought Id sniff out of Batch 1 on the first time around. 

**Taste:** The vanilla here is far more pronounced. More complex and balanced. Theres a bit more chocolate and a lot of molasses.

**Finish:** Its a bit shorter than Batch 1 but it is far more complex. Were headed in a good direction, folks. 

**Overall:** It improves. Still not sure Id clamber to bunker these suckers but the improvement from Batch 1 is very evident.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
