**The Schtick:** This is a single barrel, cask strength, release from Privateer in Massachusetts. 

-----

**Distiller:** Privateer

**Bottler:** Privateer

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  52% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Floral, honey, nutty, molasses, brown sugar. Not super dense, but pleasant. Fresh baked bread.   

**Taste:** Thin, more fruit here than #1, molasses, brown sugar. More sweet, less spice. Faint banana bread. Not overbearing. Mild funk, if any. Pepper, Werthers caramels. Pleasant, sweet, rich. 

**Finish:** Short, but sweet, and theres some rich qualities here. Mild oak, some tobacco, pepper. Faint bananas, peaches, confectioners sugar. Molasses reigns supreme.

**Overall:** Again, Privateer is doing a great job of walking a fine line between a variety of profile, and to their benefit. Sweet, nice wood component, good fruitiness, nice maple structure. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
