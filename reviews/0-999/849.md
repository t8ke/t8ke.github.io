**The Schtick:** This is a 100% Molasses rum, bottled at cask strength with no additives, colorants, or filtering. It is produced by Privateer, a distillery in Ipswitch, Massachusetts. I have a wide swath of samples from Privateer to review in the coming days and i look forward to seeing how a small distilling operation in a strange location can fare. Cue the excitement.

**Distiller:** Privateer

**Bottler:** Privateer

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 57.7% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Clove, honey, molasses, maple syrup, pancakes.   

**Taste:** Thin, but no heat. Pleasant. Honey, pancakes, molasses, artificial syrup, clove, some pepper. Doesnt feel dosed, so I imagine this has no additives. Sweet, nice spicy backbone, light fruits. Mostly molasses and oak focused. 

**Finish:** Medium length, mild still in the heat department. Brown sugar, pepper, oak, faint pepper. 

**Overall:** Really nice. Great structure, good balance of sweet and savory, with a nice hint of spice. Well produced.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
