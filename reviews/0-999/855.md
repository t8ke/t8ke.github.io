**The Schtick:** This is a Privateer Single Cask referred to as Harvest Nectar. It is matured in third fill Four Roses casks.

-----

**Distiller:** Privateer

**Bottler:** Privateer

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 47.4% ABV

**Age:** 2 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, oranges, bubble gum, vanilla. Pepper. Not super robust, or complex, but pleasant.  

**Taste:** Thin, no real heat. Low proof, for sure. Confectioners sugar, orange peel, pepper, vanilla cream, lemon lime, cake. 

**Finish:** Short, rich oak (surprising), nice clove. Good spice here. Balances well against the substantial sweet in the palate. 

**Overall:** Enjoyable, but a bit young, the mouthfeel could use some work and Id like to see some more cooperation between the palate and the finish. No major complaints, though.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
