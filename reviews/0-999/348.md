**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 55.6% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet and spicy. Yeasty like bakery sweets. Frosting, faint butter caramel. Not a lot of floral or fruity here, just sweet, dry and spicy.

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Sweet and rich. Theres a nice peppery spice to follow. The heat is a little unconstrained here, but not by a lot. Some faint floral notes are here also but the sweet / spicy theme is really the big picture.

**Finish:** Long, just a hair hot, but still very nice.

**Overall:** I really enjoyed this but not as much as some past releases. I was blessed by a friend who found a couple - he was generous enough to let me and another buddy split this bottle at cost. Im very glad I took him up on the offer. Half a bottle isperfect though since this is sort of a mood dram for me. Nevertheless the quality is high and I think it punches just right with a lot of their PS bottles also. Four Roses juice at cask strength is just delicious. Rank 7.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
