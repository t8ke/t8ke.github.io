**The Schtick:** We make a brief return to the days of old. I have not wobbled in some time, but it sure it time to Gobble again. /u/thpbltblt recently bought some bottles of the stuff and wanted my opinion of them, so he sent a couple samples along. Im sure you all remember the schtick from last time so let us dive in!

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  55% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Toffee, caramel, clove and some faint citrus peel. Vanilla and butter cream. Some turkey spice, but not too much.  

**Taste:** Thick and rich, loaded with sweets like vanilla and caramel. Hot, though, much hotter than expected. Good deal of pepper and oak. Really sweet overall, but also pretty hot. 

**Finish:** Medium to long with really rich toffee. Heat persists, though. 

**Overall:** This was sort of an interesting battle. On one hand, the notes were delicious and rich. But the heat was pretty overbearing, especially in the palate. I get, though, that at 55% we really shouldnt expect a complete lack of heat, I think its sometimes just more evident given how much spice some of these Turkeys can have. It was the major factor in keeping this from climbing higher, though. 

Thanks for reading!
