**The Schtick:** This is a single barrel of bourbon from Wild Turkey under the Russells Reserve label. This was picked by a variety of bourbon distillery Master Distillers for a springtime festival in Kentucky. This hails from D-6. 

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  55% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, maple, light cocoa. Some ethanol, light melon and stewed fruits. Really dark and fruity, very rich, without being an oak overdrive.   

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Minor heat. Cherry, oak and tobacco. Some waffle cone, nougat and caramel. Some bitterness, but nothing too offensive. The red fruits are really prominent: cherry, currant and some blackberry. Lots of clove and trademark Turkey spice. 

**Finish:** Medium length, cocoa, caramel and lots of tobacco. Fruity character sort of diminishes to give way to clove, tobacco and cocoa. 

**Overall:** I guess these guys sort of know what there doing. I really enjoyed this, as it strayed from being an oaky spice bomb and introduced some really nice tobacco and dark fruits. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
