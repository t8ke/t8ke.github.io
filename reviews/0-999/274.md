[**Review #274 | Rye Review #150 - High West Rendezvous Rye Finished in Ex-Campfire**]( https://t8ke.review/review-274-high-west-rendezvous-rye-ex-campfire/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** High West 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Rye spice, dill, brown sugar, molasses, mild smoke (very mild)

**Taste:** Dilly, sharp rye, pine and molasses, sugar, brown sugar, syrup. Faintest smoke, very faint but integrated well.

**Finish:** Long, warming, Very dilly and loaded with molasses. Excellent balance of the typical rye and a little hint of smoke.

**Overall:** Delicious and unique. I quite enjoy both Rendezbous Rye and their campfire bottling each on their own and it was really cool to see these two come together. The flavors are prominent, bold yet balanced. Im going to give this a Rank 7.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
