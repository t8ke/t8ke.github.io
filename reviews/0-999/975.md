**Nose:**  Pungent peat, earthy vegetal funk, rich stewed fruits and vibrant currants, blackberry and cherry. Faint minerality, light soapstone and some brine and pepper. Powerful. 

**Taste:** Thick, rich and briney. Very little heat despite the elevated ABV. First I notice a wealth of berries - blackberries, currants, cherries as well as stewed fruits like figs, dates and a toffee note. Rich pipe tobacco, cracked black pepper and oak are present as well. Excellent structure. The peat storms in, earthy and vegetal. Some sea air. No iodine or bandages here. Dark chocolate. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and ashy. Lots more ash and burning wood here than in the palate, with the fruits and chocolate taking a back seat. Great oak integration, rich pepper, musty tobacco and then a blackberry preserve note. 

**Overall:** All throughout the bottle as Ive worked through it, Ive more or less anguished over where this falls to me. Some days I wanted it to be peatier. Others, fruitier. In the end, though, its clear to me that this strikes a very noteworthy balance between the two, without muting either. Over time, the musty tobacco notes have really grown, which plays perfectly with the berries, the peat, the ash, the brine and the fig. Id be remiss to give this anything less than what I settled on. Its incredible stuff. 

Thanks for reading!
