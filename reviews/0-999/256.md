[**Review #256 | Scotch Review #256 - Aberlour 18yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-256-aberlour-18/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Aberlour

**Bottler:** Aberlour

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  48% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Woody sulphur, sweet sweet fudgy wine notes. Maple, figs, dates, plumbs, raspberry jam. Odd orange citrus and leather.

**Taste:**   Thin, sharp, hot and acidic. The sherry is apparent here but its nothing like the nose. The deep complexity isnt present and its like a sweet acidic sticky mess. Lots of fig, cocoa, raspberry syrup

**Finish:**  Medium to short, hot, sulphuric and really quite abrubt. Theres little sherry notes to speak of.

**Overall:** Im surprised and a little sad to comment on how quickly this dram went downhill. I enjoyed the nose immensely and then all of that pleasure just wisped away. Ive not yet found many drams that seem to have sherry sulphur in them but this is an overload, almost to the point of washing out all of the other notes. For an expensive, old bottle, this isnt particularly great. Theres some redeeming quality in the nose - I could sit and smell it all day but Id save the actual consumption for another dram that can follow through. For this reason, Im giving Aberlour 18 a Rank 5.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
