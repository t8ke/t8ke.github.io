[**Review #474 | Rum Review #474 - Faultline CUribBeAN 17yr Rum (K&amp;L Exclusive)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-474-faultline-kl-curibbean/)

**The Schtick:** This ones a little sticky. Its pegged as a Jamaican product but the naming implies otherwise. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** KLWines

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 17 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet caramel, bananas foster, overripe fruit, honey, brown sugar. The label says oak casks, and Id be inclined to believe ex-bourbon, almost. It could just as easily be new charred oak though based on the rich sweetness here on top of the rum profile. Very molasses, vanilla, brown sugar forward on the nose to go with that nice overripe fruit funk.   

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, very mild heat. Real nice for the proof. Overripe frit, cream, vanilla, caramel. Pineapple, toffee and some nice funk. 

**Finish:** Long with a little heat and some faint astringency. Not bad, though. Drying, oaky and fruity. Lots of tannins. 

**Overall:** Overall, I really enjoyed this. The oak is very prominent, though, which is both good and bad. I really enjoyed the flavor profile demonstrated here but the finish was just a hair oakier/dryer/more tannic than I would have liked. Not too much, but a little bit. This was clearanced out recently for $59.99 and I wish I grabbed a back up. Sigh. Such is life. 

Thanks for reading!
