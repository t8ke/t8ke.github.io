**The Schtick:** "This cigar-worthy rum has an alluring and perfumed nose that calls to mind nicotiana flowers, leather, and dried orange peel. Upon tasting it, our Head Distiller immediately marked the with DD, tagging it as a unique expression that should not be blended, but instead set aside as a perfect example of power, balanced by delicacy. Our Head Distiller will be enjoying her bottle with an Ashton cigar." - Privateer Website

**Nose:**  Vibrant waffles, honey, maple, toffee. Sweet, faint hint of spice. Some fruity funk, mostly guava and some light banana. Nice wood influence, no ethanol. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, no heat. Rich fruitiness here, almost bananas foster and honey roasted peanuts. Rich, sweet, dessert-y. Oak is here for sure, and lends a great hand in balancing sweetness without bringing bitterness to the light. Faintly meaty. Overall, rich, sweet, complex. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet maple, honey, some oak. Faint pepper, the fruitiness continues in the form of banana, apple and some lime. 

**Overall:** Complex, rich, well proofed. This was very enjoyable, and easily my favorite to date. 

Thanks for reading!
