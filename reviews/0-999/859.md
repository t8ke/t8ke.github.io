**The Schtick:** This is what I believe to be a sourced release from Old Forge. They boast having 8-9 year old Tennessee Bourbon Whiskey, and this is a store pick, cask strength release. If this is true, it would be ironic, given that they label their products as hand forged spirits. If someone has more information on whether this is sourced, or their own product, I welcome your input.

**Distiller:** Old Forge

**Bottler:** Old Forge Distillery 

**Selection:** McScrooges

**ABV:** 66.5% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Wet grass, sour fruits, ethanol. Faint caramel, some corn, papaya, musty cardboard. 

**Taste:** Thin, hot, musty and sweet. Some woody character, mild pepper and tobacco. Wet sawdust. Caramel, honey, creamy.

**Finish:** Long, but searing hot, and a bit rough. Props, though, there is no musty craft character here, which is refreshing. Pepper, oak, cocoa, some caramel.

**Overall:** This is distinctly craft, but on the verge of overcoming it. The age, and the proof, are so close to burying that craft crap note and blossoming into a balanced, sweet, savory bourbon. Im going to give this the benefit of the doubt, and give it a hard earned 4.

Thanks for reading!
