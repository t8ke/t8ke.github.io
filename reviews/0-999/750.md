**The Schtick:** This is a well aged wheated whiskey released under the Bernheim label and selected by McScrooges.

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** McScrooges

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich caramel, waffles, rich fruitiness. Berries, apple, pear. Creme brulee. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, no real heat. Fruity and loaded with vanilla. Passion fruit, pear, apple and faint raspberry. Nice clove presence with healthy caramel character. Really sweet and fruity. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and loaded with honey. Fruity character continues and balances nicely with some clove and rich vanilla. 

**Overall:** I really enjoyed this - probably one of the better wheated releases I have had outside of WLW.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
