**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven HIll

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 65.8% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Maple, honey, molasses, oak, a good deal of ethanol

**Taste:** Sweet cereal grans, molasses, honey, vanilla. This is one hot dram though, almost searing to the tongue and throat. Other than the general feel of malty sweetness, a lot of depth is lost to the scourge of the proof. Its not a gentle heat.

**Finish:** Long, hot and sustaining. Sweet and savory, loaded with vanilla, caramel, malty sweetness etc. It tastes like youd expect 65%+ whiskey would taste.

**Overall:** Overall, this isnt terrible. But it was an LE product, one I think was expensive (correct me if Im wrong) and I definitely wouldnt seek one out for a price greater than $60 because this is barrel proof but its not gentle about it. Thats not to say that every barrel proofer should be gentle or good at hiding proof but this dram is none of those things. It borders on hot hot garbage and if I couldnt get at a little of some of the complexity under the heat, this would score far worse. I enjoyed it but it goes to show that not all LEs are truly exceptional. Im giving this a Rank 6 as a result.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
