**The Schtick:** This is a release from Signatory Vintages UCF line. It is a 10yr Edradour that has been fully matured in First Fill sherry casks (type unknown)

-----

**Distiller:** Edradour 

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sherry, pepper, tobacco, sweet stewed fruits. Honey, figs, dates, grapes and raspberries. Butter cream and vanilla. Interesting meatiness to it, with lots of melon character.  

**Taste:** Medium, sweet honey. Vanilla, toffee, caramel, faint sulfur. Faint cocoa. Delicious overall, sherry and base spirit blend nicely. 

**Finish:** Short, faintly astringent. Some pepper, nice sherry sweetness but also some bitterness. 

**Overall:** Overall, I really enjoyed this up until the finish which was too short, and a bit bitter / plasticy for my tastes. Would love to see if that wrinkle is worked out at cask strength, but this isnt too bad at all. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
