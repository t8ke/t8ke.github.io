[**Review #838 | Bourbon Review #450 - Winchester Straight Bourbon**]( https://t8ke.review/review-838-winchester-straight-bourbon/)

**The Schtick:** This is a Total Wine house brand that is sourced from TerrePURE in the Carolinas - a company that "hyper ages" distills products by attempting to age them faster than conventionally possible using a proprietary method. They claim that this process will revolutionize the industry by providing producers with products that are comparable to well aged bourbons and ryes, in just a fraction of that time. Lets see how it is.  

-----

**Distiller:** TerrePURE

**Bottler:** TerrePURE for Total Wine

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** 2 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Musty, caramel, pepper, clove, cardboard, still fake and sweet

**Taste:** Oats, musty, clove, caramel, some body

**Finish:** Short, very hot, musty and fake, caramel

**Overall:** This could be worse, but could be way better. Some oak saves it. 

Thanks for reading!
