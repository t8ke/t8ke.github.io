**The Schtick:**  I apologize if it seems like Im a C&amp;K rep at this point - I promise I"m not. Ive either purchased or split each of these bottles myself. They were what effectively launched me into my love of brandy, so we have C&amp;K to thank for that, though. This is the line of Beer Barrel finished brandies released by Copper and Kings in 2016/2017. To the best of my knowledge, there were only these 5 to start. Ill be reviewing them in the order I tried them, polishing off each of my bottles this week. Each was aged for some unspecified time in ex-bourbon, then finished in a select beer vessel for an unspecified amount of time. Each is NCF, NCA and bottled at 111pf. Ill admit, I have no idea how they did the Oskar Blues one.

**Nose:**  Rich fruits, malted grains, almost graham cracker. Syrupy fig, apple, grapes and some light hoppiness.                                                                                                         +
 Sweet vanilla, pepper, stewed fruits. Some sulfur, nice tobacco notes. A hint of smoke, but nothing like an Islay scotch, or that awful "cigarette in the fermenter" note that some garbage craft beers have. +
Sweet vanilla, caramel, malted grain, some nice raisen. A hint of cocoa, rich toffee, stewed fruits like figs, dates, pears.                                                                                   +
A bit more subdued, stone fruits, sweet creamy vanilla, tobacco, a faint smokiness, almost like a smoked meat.                                                                                                 +
Rich cocoa, leather, tobacco, some allspice, apples. Figs, stone fruits and stewed sherry notes. Its almost like a blend of dark espresso, Oloroso and PX sherry with a nice peppery backbone.  

**Taste:** Thick mouthfeel, sweet syrupy fruits. Theres some real funkiness here, not quite hoppy (think Charbay notes) but theres some really doughy, yeasty, funky notes to accompany cocoa, stewed fruits and some sulfur and pipe tobacco.                                                                                                     +
Nice rich mouthfeel, sweet syrupy fruits. Lots of cocoa, some allspice, rich peppery tobacco. Overall, its tough to pick out where the brandy notes end and the porter notes start, but it makes for a nice complex dram. Its still sweet, as most brandies are, but leans in the cocoa direction, rather than just super jammy fruits. +
 Thick mouthfeel, rich dates, cocoa, some tobacco, light sulfur. Vanilla and cream are here also. Toffee, raisins, apples, and almost some PX sherry notes.                                                                                                                                                                             +
Pretty rich, not a lot of heat. Some funky fruits, apples, pears, vanilla and some cocoa. Theres a hint of salted caramel and some toffee.                                                                                                                                                                                              +
Thick, rich. No heat. Rich cocoa here, some faint cinnamon and allspice. I cant really shake the feeling of chocolate dipped strawberries and a blend of Oloroso and PX, without the cloying sweetness. Complex and well done. 

**Finish:** Medium, sweet and lots more agave here. 

**Overall:** Overall, this was kind of a Frankenstein dram. Like a lot of their other experiments, I thought this was relatively good, but its not really something Id reach for all of the time. Its definitely a mood dram. 

Thanks for reading!
