[**Review #272 | Scotch Review #115 - Strathclyde 26yo**]( https://t8ke.review/review-272-strathclyde-26yr-grain/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Strathclyde

**Bottler:** Strathclyde

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 55.1% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Cream, vanilla, honey, baking bread, nilla wafers

**Taste:** Thin, honey and almond forward. Sort of hot but enjoyable. Not wildly deep, but very creamy, vanilla, honey forward

**Finish:** Long, a little rough, sweet though and very pleasant.

**Overall:** This would have made an excellent cask strength summers night porch dram. Its light, sweet, fairly straightforward and doesnt try to be something it isnt. Im giving this a Rank 6 - its not mind blowing but it is pretty good and its really quite fun to try something thats really getting up there in the years. I know this is grain and not technically malt whiskey but I still wanted to review it, especially since I rather enjoyed it. I dont know what this cost, but assuming it wasnt an arm and a leg, I think its a fine dram. If nothing, an enjoyable experiment.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
