[**Review #152 | Scotch Review #57 - The Macallan 12yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-152-the-macallan-12yr/)

**The Schtick:** This is an age stated release from The Macallan. It is the original, which means it is sherry matured, rather than oak and finish.

-----

**Distiller:** Macallan

**Bottler:** Macallan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Thick, fruity sherry. Theres some chocolate, fig and a hint of clove spice. Its mildly earthy but very sweet. It amazes me how much sherry depth makes it in here in just 12 years and not at Cask Strength.

**Taste:** Thinner mouth feel but satisfying. Not at all hot, theres plenty of cocoa, raisins, mild earthiness and a good deal of fig and fresh, red grapes. 

**Finish:** Medium but has a good bit of depth. Its sweet and not at all bitter. That same earthy, chocolatey sherry sticks around.  

**Overall:** I dont know how to say it so Ill be blunt. I love it. I hate that I love it. I wish it was still the inexpensive product of yesteryear but for the price becoming a stretch but to me its solid, age stated sherry at a not exorbitant price. I want to revisit Aberlour 12 NCF and see how they compare. 

Thanks for reading!
