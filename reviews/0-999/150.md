[**Review #150 | Rye Review #85 - Thomas H. Handy Sazerac Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-150-thomas-h-handy-rye-2013/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 6 year old, cask strength rye released as part of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection each Fall. Proof varies with vintage. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 64.2% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Theres some metallic note first off which I havent noticed a whole lot before. It fades quickly though to the heavy hand of buttery molasses and maple. This one seems to be the hottest of the 4 and a little less spicy. More overall astringency - but what notes are there are just cranked to 11.    

**Taste:** I was right - this one certainly is hotter. Its no GTS or Stagg Jr Batch 1, but theres some heat. Still delicious though, its got the most maple and molasses and oak of the 4 Ive tasted today so Im willing to accept the extra heat. The buttery rye and pepper is well pronounced and delicious.

**Finish:** Its hotter (notice the trend) but not as long as some of the others. Its still a head above some other ryes though. Tons of pepper and oak on the way out. 

**Overall:** Consistently delicious.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
