[**Review #218 | Scotch Review #218 - The Macallan 18**]( https://t8ke.review/review-218-the-macallan-18/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Macallan

**Bottler:** Macallan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Huge sherry notes, clove, cinnamon, rich plums and raisins, cocoa, sweet and creamy

**Taste:** Sweet and rich, cocoa and mild heat. Toffee, maple and confectioners sugar. Huge jammy notes. Its really deep and Im enjoying it quite a bit. Im a bit of a sherry whore myself, and this is hitting a lot of the right notes.

**Finish:** Medium, thick sherry, sweet and fruity. Complex blend of sherry and cocoa.

**Overall:** Ill cut to the chase. This is exceptional. I like it a lot and its thick and complex. Id pay $80 or $99 in a heart beat for this. Theres one problem though. This sells for well over $200 and sometimes closer to $300 in unfortunate markets. I wouldnt pay that in a heart beat which is where the rub is. This is a very high quality dram but its not worth the coin that Macallan wants. This seems to be a trend and seems to explain the Macallan hate. Its good though and I like it a lot - for that reason Ill rate this dram a 7. Nothing to sneeze at.

Thanks for reading!
