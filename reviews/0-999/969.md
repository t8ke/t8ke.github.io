**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of Glen Moray spirit by the Jewish Whisky Companys Single Cask Nation line of expressions. It is 12 years old and spent the first 6 years maturing in ex-bourbon and then was moved to first fill Madeira casks for the remaining 6 years. It is bottled at cask strength and received no coloring or filtering.

**Distiller:** Glen Moray

**Bottler:** Single Cask Nation

**Selection:** Single Cask Nation

**ABV:** 54.7% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich, sweet, syrupy fruits. Cherry, currant, blackberry. Sweet honey. Faint tobacco. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, no heat. Sweet, jammy, fruits. Faint tobacco, nice clove characteristic. Jammy structured with some spice to reign it in. Surprisingly nice oak body, as well.

**Finish:** Long, lots of stewed fruits and sweet. Super jammy, loads of berries, some vanilla cake and cocoa.

**Overall:** If there was a whiskey for Smuckers to stake their name on, this would be the one. It was super enjoyable, brought a surprising amount of richness to the table and also delivered well in not being cloyingly sweet or fruity. I think that 12 years in first fill Madeira may have brought this overboard, so Im thankful for whoever decided to make this a 50:50 maturation, using first fill Madeira for the second half. Once again, a unique, and delicious SCN selection.

Thanks for reading!
