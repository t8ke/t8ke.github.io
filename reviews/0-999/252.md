[**Review #252 | Rye Review #138 - Jack Daniels Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-252-jack-daniels-rye/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Brown-Forman

**Bottler:** Brown-Forman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  47% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Caramel, wet cardboard (a weird papery note I get in a lot of younger ryes), molasses, pleaseant rye spice, cereal grains and a good hint of brown sugar. Theres almost no signature BF banana here but there is some hints of a light fruitiness. Its light though and very faint.

**Taste:** Medium thin mouthfeel, no heat. Mild banana here but only just so - followed by lots of sweet caramel and some sugar. Theres an odd lack of activity here. No heat, mild flavors despite the relative boldness of the caramel / sugar. Kinda just halts.

**Finish:** Medium and also gentle. No sign of proof or heat here. It grows spicier and slightly astringent but this is a welcome balance with the one-note show of caramel and sugar laced with light fruit.

**Overall:** Its really awesome to see some variety and expedition in the Jack Daniels line and since I love rye, this was also welcome. Unfortunately, this rye isnt my new favorite rye. Its good, but a little boring and sort of expensive. That being said, it doesnt have any gaping flaws and it was delicious either way. Im giving this dram a Rank 5.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
