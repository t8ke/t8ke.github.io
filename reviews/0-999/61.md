**The Schtick:** A cask strength sherried matured single cask offering from Edradour. 

-----

**Distiller:** Edradour

**Bottler:** Edradour

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 57.8% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Plums, red fruit and syrupy sherry sweetness. Theres leather and a wallop of sherry spice but its complex and delicious. 

**Taste:** Huge sherry. Lots of dark fruit, raisins, grapes and plumbs. Sweet and thick with an oily mouth feel. 

**Finish:** Long, surprisingly hot, but well blended. Lots of spice here. 

**Overall:** Ive never had an Edradour expression before. Its a massive sherry dram and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Yum.   

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
