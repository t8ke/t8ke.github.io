[**Review #315 | Scotch Review #128 - Douglas Laings Big Peat Christmas 2012**]( https://t8ke.review/review-315-big-peat-christmas-2012/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Douglas Laing

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 53.6% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Like the name suggests, "Big Peat"! Pepper, peat smoke, vegetal funk, if creamy vanilla. A one two punch of peppery, vegetal peat and sweet sweet vanilla.

**Taste:** Very sweet. The smoke is here also, and its definitely intense but it is well balanced with the extra sweetness. Its like a smoky vanilla cake. Or pound cake. Peppery and vegetal peat takes a backseat. Mouth feel is on the thinner side but still good. Proof works well here.

**Finish:** Long, only mild heat, very sweet still but the smoke grows. Very smokey here but more favoring the vegetal, rather than ashy or cigarette like.

**Overall:** I really like the dynamic nature of this one. Massive peat, pepper and smoke that gives way to sweet pound cake only to surrender once more to the smoke. I really enjoyed this dram, and Im going to rate it Rank 7 as a result.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
