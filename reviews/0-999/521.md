**The Schtick:** Four Roses Private Selects are arguably the best value in bourbon. Producing 10 different recipes regularly bottles at cask strength, plenty of variety is available to even the average consumer.  

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** The Wine and Cheese Place

**ABV:** 58.3% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Floral, oaky, caramel. Toffee, some ethanol, cloves and a bit of spice

**Taste:** Rich, thick, some heat. Sweet, rich oaky caramel. Pepper, tobacco, less fruity and surprisingly more spicy

**Finish:** Long and mild for the proof, filled with cocoa, tobacco, caramel and oak

**Overall:** I like this but its a bit dry/oaky/peppery for my tastes. Typically OESK doesnt taste this oaky, especially at this age, but the bitterness and tannins were almost overpowering. Im going to chalk this up to an outlier - it was still good but it doesnt approach the ceiling of some really phenomenal OESK picks that Ive purchased in the past. 

Thanks for reading!
