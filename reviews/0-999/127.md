[**Review #127 | Scotch Review #52 - Johnnie Walker Green Label**]( https://t8ke.review/review-127-johnnie-walker-green-label/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 15yr age stated blend from Johnnie Walker. It sits between their 12yr Black label and 18yr Gold Label. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Johnnie Walker

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, light floral notes and some lemon. Doughy and sweet. Mild fleeting smoke?

**Taste:** Thin mouthfeel and very mild but theres some sweet vanilla cake, lemon zest and a tiny hint of oak and smoke. Its pleasant and unoffensive but not boring, which I find exceptional (relatively).

**Finish:** Short-Medium with some decent heat. More than the mouth feel which is odd. Smokier here too but the doughy sweetness is still prominent and balanced. 

**Overall:** I love to hate on the Diageo overlords but this bottle really impressed me. It wasnt boring, it had some good diversity. Its delicious, sweet and floral with some nice smoke balance and I enjoyed drinking this far more than expected.

Thanks for reading!
