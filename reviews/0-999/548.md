**Nose:**  Sweet vanilla, coconut, faint anise, nice light coconut character with a light sweetness. Smells like natural coconut, not artificial coconut garbage.  

**Taste:** Thicker mouthfeel, no heat. Really nice coconut character here - its easily the most prominent note here. Again, not syrupy sweet - it is effervescent and light, very natural. Light butter cream, faint lime zest, hint of plantain. Overall, its very natural and thats a great thing. Doesnt taste dramatically dosed. 

**Finish:** Fairly long for the proof, lots of coconut. 

**Overall:** This would make fine cocktails. I really enjoyed this because of how natural the coconut influence was - complete opposite of Malibu related products and in the best way. This would be great for adding nice character to cocktails. 

Thanks for reading!
