[**Review #929 | Rum Review #52 - Ron Relicario Dominicano  Supremo**]( https://t8ke.review/review-929-ron-relicario-dominicano-supremo/)

**The Schtick:** This was a bottle that I tried blind and I reviewed live on the Whiskey Network Discord server, then got the reveal in order to fill in relevant details here. 

-----

**Distiller:** Relicario

**Bottler:** Relicario

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, melon, brown sugar. Almonds, amaretto. Pepper, faint tobacco. Sweet, sugary and some light lemon and lime. No sulfur or big meaty funk.   

**Taste:** Honey, brown sugar. Maple syrup. Light cocoa, all sweet, no real bitterness or heat. Minor dosage. Faint cola. 

**Finish:** Short, not super complex, but enjoyable enough. Cola, brown sugar, light lime and some vanilla cream. Mild pepper. 

**Overall:** This is nice, but not super complex or exciting. It has lots of pleasant notes, nothing too crazy or funky or meaty or aggressive, which is completely fine. If I were to use this in a cocktail, I would probably use it in a daiquiri. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
