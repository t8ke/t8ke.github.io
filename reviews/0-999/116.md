[**Review #116 | Scotch Review #45 - Kilchoman Sherry Cask**]( https://t8ke.review/review-116-kilchoman-sherry-cask/)

**The Schtick:** Kilchoman aged in a sherry cask.  

-----

**Distiller:** Kilchoman

**Bottler:** Kilchoman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Theres brine and peat, its a sweet peat with nice tires and vegetation but no bandaids. Mmmmm. Very mild hint of the sherry sweet and some vanilla. Mostly smoke though.

**Taste:** For a sherry casked dram, there isnt nearly as much as I was expecting. Mostly smoke and peat, with some cinnamon, vanilla and hay with a mild fringe of sherry here and there. I think this is due to the relative youth of the spirit. 

**Finish:** Medium and a bit sweeter than the palate would have made me think was coming. Still mostly smoke and hay, but theres some brine sticking around here too. Its interesting and playful.

**Overall:** I like this. I dont love it - but if it sat in a PX or Olo barrel for a few more years, we might have a whole new beast on our hands. I probably wouldnt pick up a full bottle yet but Im heavily invested in trying future years expressions. I like Kilchoman and what theyre doing and Im looking forward to trying more of their offerings

Thanks for reading!
