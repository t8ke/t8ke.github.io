**The Schtick:** This is a small format bottle of a WB Liquors selection of Eagle Rare 10. Eagle Rare 10 uses Buffalo Traces Mashbill 1 mashbill and is aged for 10 years. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** WB

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet vanilla, oak, passion fruit, caramel and toffee. Nice tobacco presence. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, no heat. Vanilla, tobacco, oak and pleasant cocoa influence. Lacking a lot of the fruitiness I get in some Eagle Rare 10 iterations, but making up for it in reach dessert richness without overbearing, bitter oak. 

**Finish:** Medium length, faint oak, cocoa and tobacco. Vanilla icing and some mild orange peel are present also. Really interesting. 

**Overall:** Definitely a unique profile for most Eagle Rare 10, this was delicious and interesting all at once. I found myself going to this bottle over and over and over because of how unique it was, and to my dismay, I came to the bottom far faster than I was expecting to. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
