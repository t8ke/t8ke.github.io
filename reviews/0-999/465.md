**The Schtick:** This is the final phase of Gobble Til You Wobble and Ill be looking at both the Bourbon and Ryes that are sold under that line. Bourbons first, ryes second. This is a modern offering from Wild Turkey with the higher entry proof. It is diluted to 104 pf and sold as a single barrel offering across the nation. Many stores have been able to do picks of these products, and extra information is available as a result. It is, still, a NAS product, though.

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** Liquor Barn

**ABV:**  52% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Caramel, allspice, some fruity melon (hmmm). Theres pears, apples, vanilla, buttercream. Its balanced well with lots of clove and an unmistakable rye scent, but to me it almost reminds me of the nose on an Alberta rye like a WP SiB CS rye. Interesting. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, the heat is in check. Fruity and spicy, cloves, apples, vanilla, toffee and a real nice spice backbone, more akin to nutmeg and clove than anything. Theres a hint of mint, but not enough to really dominate the profile.  Really nice, pretty unique and not at all like I expected. 

**Finish:** Long and complex, theres some nice rye spice blended with the fruity melon notes and the vanilla. Its a sweet finish with a hint of spice, which makes it surprisingly nice.  

**Overall:** This is interesting, and I have no idea of mashbill but its definitely a barely legal profile in my mind. Its sweet, fruity, and complex - all of the flavors blend well without the rye spices dominating. 

Thanks for reading!
