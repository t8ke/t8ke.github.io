[**Review #7 | Rye Review #7 - High West Double Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-7-high-west-double-rye-2015/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** High West 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  I get a really strange metallic smell along with some rye and dill notes. Hmmmm.

**Taste:** Really, quite spicy with some rubber and acetone notes at the end. This shit is funky.

**Finish:** Short and harsh compared to the other HW offerings. It leaves a really rough acetone feel in my throat, which I cant say I totally love.

**Overall:** Okay, I might have sounded displeased but its not terrible. Theres some overarching notes that I dont totally love but for the $31 I paid, I cant really complain. It tastes young, potentially grainy and just not up to par with some other ryes I have on the shelf.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
