**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** Total Wine

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years

**Nose:**  Sweet toffee, vanilla, fruity passion fruit and strawberry. Hint of oak and some nice clove. ER10 has always been fruity for me but this brings a 

**Taste:** Decent mouthfeel, no hint of ethanol. Sweet, fruity, really balanced and nice. Lots of toffee, vanilla, clove, and the return of that fruity backbone. Some caramel too. No astringency or bitterness. This is undoubtedly ER10 at its core, balancing clove, fruit and sweetness. For 10yrs old, its not, nor has it ever been, really oaky, which I like. This pick has a little bit more than Ive tasted in the past, but it blends nicely.

**Finish:** Medium length, no heat. Its sweet and features a fair share more of some spice and oak. Really quite pleasant.

**Overall:** Damn good and especially for the price. I really like this pick. Eagle Rare is rarely (heh) a miss for me, and this store pick is no exception. I think this must be the 6th or 7th pick Ive done now and each has shown a great take on balancing the fruitiness, dessert sweetness and integration of oak and spice in a different but delicious way. Wish I had gotten more before they ran out. Wisconsin is becoming a tater-ific place to live now too. Rats. Rank 7

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
