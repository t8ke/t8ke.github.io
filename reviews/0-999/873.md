[**Review #873 | Rum Review #42 - Wray and Nephew Jamaican Overproof Rum**]( https://t8ke.review/review-873-wray-and-nephew-jamaican-overproof-rum/)

**The Schtick:** This is supposedly the best selling rum in Jamaica, garnering over 90% of domestic sales. That said, this is an unaged white rum, bottled at an eye watering 63% ABV. Priced firmly in the "what a steal" category, this makes a compelling addition to go alongside other unaged, overproofed rums in the sector.

**Distiller:** J Wray &amp; Nephew

**Bottler:** J. Wray Nephew

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  63% ABV

**Nose:**  Lightly funky, sugar cane. Vanilla icing. Rich sweetness, nice banana and some other fruits, mild funk. 

**Taste:** Vanilla cream, mild funk. Some heat, but really mild for the proof. Rotting bananas. Some burning rubber. Sweet icing. 

**Finish:** Medium, hot, rotting fruits, some rubber, sweet confectioners sugar.

**Overall:** This was actually tolerable neat and also makes a darn good cocktail.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
