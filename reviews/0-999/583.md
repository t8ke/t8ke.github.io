[**Review #583 | Bourbon Review #334 - Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve (Lincoln Road "Sweetness")**]( https://t8ke.review/review-583-knob-creek-single-barrel-reserve-lincoln-road-sweetness/)

**The Schtick:**  Knob Creek Single Barrels have long been a product easily available at most stores. In the last several years, picking private barrels of various ages has become more commonplace. Picks between 9 and 16 years of age have been popping up with great regularity and Ive taken it upon myself to try a variety and see how they fare. Some time ago, Knob Creek exhibited what may have been the largest barrel variation commonly agreed on in the bourbon community with some barrels ranging from wretched to godly. It has been my feeling that, as of late, the overall quality of these barrels being picked has risen, adding a slightly higher floor than existed before.

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** Lincoln Road

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 13 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Faint heat, oak, caramel and vanilla.  Peanut brittle, faint fruitiness. More on the dark cocoa side of things, with some rich raspberry - as opposed to some of the strawberry Ive gotten in other picks. Its earthy, sweet and theres a nice toffee / peanut brittle facet to give it some life. 

**Taste:** Pepper, oak, vanilla, cocoa and toffee. Loads of peanut brittle. Really thick and rich and sweet, no heat at all. Thick toffee, faint stone fruits, nice cocoa and peanut brittle is a great combo here.  

**Finish:** Long, sweet, mild heat. Toffee is delicious here.  

**Overall:** This is another standout for balance between deep, earthy flavors, bright sweet flavors and an underlying fruitiness that manages to not overpower either. Its delicious and delightfully balanced compared to a lot of other picks Ive tried.  

Thanks for reading!
