[**Review #698 | Bourbon Review #396 - Mystery Bourbon Blend - gleaver home sample**]( https://t8ke.review)

**The Schtick:** This was a blind mystery sample that was sent to me. I have made a guess and gotten the reveal to fill in the useful information here. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Blend

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**    % ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Heavy clove, floral caramel, smells like Four Roses but its much sweeter than I would expect. Tons of vanilla butter cream, clove, allspice, tobacco and pepper.

**Taste:** Thick, rich molasses. Hot, though. Maple, tobacco, molasses, floral clove and spice. 

**Finish:** Medium length, minty, hot. Sweet cream, caramel, molasses.

**Overall:** erall: Bamboozled! This is a blend. Gleaver blended 60% of a Four Roses OBSF and 40% of a SAOS SiB 10yr. This explains a little, but Im disappointed I abandoned by flimsy hunch and thought craft. Either way, this shit is always fun, and blind is the best way to learn. Thanks!

Thanks for reading!
