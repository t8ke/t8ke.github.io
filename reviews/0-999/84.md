[**Review #84 | Bourbon Review #46 - Corner Creek**]( https://t8ke.review/review-84-corner-creek/)

**The Schtick:** Mmmm, craft whiskey. 

-----

**Distiller:** Corner Creek

**Bottler:** Corner Creek

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  44% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Very sweet, lots of vanilla and cream. Some mild cinnamon and pepper.   

**Taste:** It has a thin mouth feel but a pretty impressive palate for craft whiskey. Its mildly astringent but well balanced with lots of vanilla and cream sweetness. Starting to strike me as a dessert bourbon. 

**Finish:** Short but nice and spicy. I like it more than I expected. 

**Overall:** I dont know a whole lot about Corner Creek and I decided not to look into it too much before I tried this. Overall, I was pretty impressed given that its a pretty low proof dram. I can totally see myself enjoying this while eating some pralines or a bowl of ice cream after dinner. Light, delicious and very gentle on the palate. Not a bad dram for the money. 

Thanks for reading!
