**The Schtick:** I tasted a Whistle Pig 10 year, barrel proof, single barrel selection that was picked for the Multnomah Whiskey Library. This is a Canadian rye, distilled at Alberta, that is sourced, barreled and bottled by WhistlePig in Vermont, USA.

-----

**Distiller:** Alberta

**Bottler:** Whistle Pig

**Selection:** Multnomah

**ABV:** 58.15% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Clove, caramel, orange peel. Toffee, tobacco, citrus. Definitely bourbon.

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, faint heat. Caramel, clove, honey, orange peel, faint cocoa. Sweet cream.

**Finish:** Medium length, some heat. Little spicy. Caramel, waffle cone, oak, clove and pepper.

**Overall:** Good and complex, guessing bourbon, Wild Turkey distillate, 6-8 years, 50-55% ABV. Guessing a RRSiB selection I havenâ€™t had yet.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
