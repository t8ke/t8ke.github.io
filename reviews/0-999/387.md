**The Schtick:**  Wild Turkey 101 is a NAS offering bottled at 101proof. The mash is standard but barrel entry proof varies based on the era in which the barrels were laid down.

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.5% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet and spicy again. Caramel, cloves, toffee, vanilla. Some nice dough. Very different than the previous sample.

**Taste:** Nice mouthfeel, little thinner, but still very pleasant. Sweet, caramel, toffee, vanilla, some clove and pepper. A bit of heat, though. Theres some faint cocoa here, chocolatey tobacco. Maybe a hint of orange peel.

**Finish:** Long, sweet and nice and peppery. Lots of interesting fruit here though, some orange, some citrus. Both faint. A good bit of cocoa.

**Overall:** This is very different that the previous test. It reminds me a bit more of previous samples that Im confident were more recent bottlings. Im going to guess this is late 90s. It has that sweetness, spice forward profile. Lots of sugary notes like the desert caramel, toffee, vanilla and cocoa that balance very well with the spice and clove and pepper. I dig this.

Thanks for reading!
