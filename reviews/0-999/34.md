[**Review #34 | Bourbon Review #19 - Journeyman Buggy Whip Wheat**]( https://t8ke.review/review-34-journeyman-buggy-whip-wheat-whiskey/)

**The Schtick:** Some small craft distillery from Michigan. Unsure of the price, unsure of the quality, unsure if I want to drink it at all.

-----

**Distiller:** Journeyman

**Bottler:** Journeyman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Alcohol, acetone, and wheat/corn. Smells a bit too much like JD #7 for comfort. Syrupy, sugary, "I should probably be mixed with coke" notes.

**Taste:** Young. Thats all there is to say. Its young, astringent and generally unbalanced. Corn overload. Might prefer to drink Mellow Corn. I think the only way to win, is not to play that game.

**Finish:** Corn. Corn. Did I say corn? Nail polish. Regret.

**Overall:** I dont know what this cost, and I dont know if its supposed to be good, but yikes, its bad. Unfortunately, I think this is a prime example of young craft product.

Thanks for reading!
