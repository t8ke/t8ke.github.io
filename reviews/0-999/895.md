[**Review #895 | Bourbon Review #469 - Old Weller Antique Annapolis Whiskey Society Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-895-old-weller-antique-ncf-annapolis-whisky-society-selection/)

**The Schtick:** This is a private selection of Old Weller Antique. It is non-chill filtered. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** Annapolis Whiskey Society

**ABV:** 53.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, tobacco, sweet cream. Corn syrup, toffee, tobacco, some rich pepper. Some ethanol and some peanut brittle. Not at all funky, leaning towards sweet. 

**Taste:** Medium to thick mouth feel. No real heat. Sweet honey, light fruits, toffee. Diminished cinnamon compared to most OWA, with tobacco, pepper, and light earthiness. 

**Finish:** Long, rich, not a lot of heat here either. Lots of sweet dessert-y notes like waffle cone, caramel, vanilla cream and some pepper and oak. The oak presence helps offset the sweets without dipping into the red hots cinnamon territory that I dont enjoy in OWA. 

**Overall:** This is really a very nice selection. I put this up there with a Plumpjack pick I had many months ago. This accentuates the things I enjoy about OWA selections and suppresses the things that make me dislike OWA in general.

Thanks for reading!
