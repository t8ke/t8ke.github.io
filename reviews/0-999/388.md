**The Schtick:**  Wild Turkey 101 is a NAS offering bottled at 101proof. The mash is standard but barrel entry proof varies based on the era in which the barrels were laid down.

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Strong clove. Some cinnamon (like red hots). Brown sugar, burnt maple. Pinesol. its bold and spicy

**Taste:** Clove, turkey spice, caramel and toffee are big here. Some heat and some brown sugar. 

**Finish:** Medium in length with some heat. I wish it were a little sweeter to balance but the clove is big and strong here. Less of that tobacco, cocoa and orange peel make me think this is a more modern sample. 

**Overall:** Overall, this is quintessential WT101. Theres lots of baking spice, some pleasant heat, and some big toffee sweetness. Im guessing this is something more modern, from the 00s (vague, I know), but Ive been surprised before. WT is really quite interesting that it can be all over the board. I could also be an outlier. 

Thanks for reading!
