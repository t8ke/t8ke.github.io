**The Schtick:** This is a K&amp;L Single Barrel bottled by Hepburns Choice - their budget IB line.

-----

**Distiller:** Dailuaine

**Bottler:** Hepburns Choice

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:** 58.3% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years

**Nose:**  Honey, caramel, toffee. Bakery sweets like donuts and cake icing. Walnuts. Faintly lactic. 

**Taste:** Sweet honey, walnuts, medium thickness with little heat. Honey is super prominent overall, with lots of sweet werthers caramel notes. Actually, its a total caramel bomb. With some faint fruity lactic notes creeping around in the back. 

**Finish:** Medium length, sort of sweet, sort of sulfuric. Tons of sweet toffee and caramel. 

**Overall:** Overall, I like this, but it wasnt terribly interesting. Mostly just a huge caramel bomb. Which is far from anything bad - I enjoyed it thoroughly despite it not being a wild ride.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
