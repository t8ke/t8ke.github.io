[**Review #156 | Scotch Review #60 - Tomatin 12yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-156-tomatin-12yr/)

**The Schtick:** This is an inexpensive malt from Tomatin, and a part of their age stated line.

-----

**Distiller:** Tomatin

**Bottler:** Tomatin

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet and malty. Lots of dough with a good deal of syrupy fruit - strawberry and fig, grapes and raisins. I dont think by default Tomatin is sherried but it sure seems to taste a bit like that, with a whole lot of malty, doughy sweetness added in as well. 

**Taste:** Sweet with some mild char. Vanilla, and grapes with a healthy dose of figs. An odd plastic note develops, but it isnt astringent or off putting. Just there, mingling with the fruits. Its less doughy here but its still very sweet. Almost in an artificially syrupy way. I enjoy it though, oddly enough. Feels kind of thin, wish it was proofed up.

**Finish:**  Medium and fruity with a tad more char and plastic. Sweet and wine like with lots of strawberry. Mild to non-existent heat. Very easy going down.

**Overall:** Overall, I dont dislike this as much as many. Id love to try a cask strength version of this spirit though.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
