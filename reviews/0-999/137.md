[**Review #137 | Rye Review #74 - Templeton Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-137-templeton-rye-re-review/)

**The Schtick:** This is a product of controversy and rule breaking. It is sourced from MGP, then flavored in Iowa but sold as a straight bourbon. Perhaps thats why there was a class action lawsuit about it. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Templeton

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Rye brown sugar syrup brown sugar 

**Taste:** Thin, sweet, syrupy rye. Barely alcoholic. Its light and theres not a whole lot here. 

**Finish:** Short, not too hot but very sweet for a rye. Missing that major rye spice I prefer to enjoy like a SAOS rye or even any of the HW offerings.

**Overall:** Yeah, its not good. I cant taste the deception and lies accompanied by marketing bullshit but what I do know is that regardless of all of that, this is a simple choice to pass over in the store. For the price and proof there are other ryes and while it doesnt have that dill kick or minty HW set of notes, its not bad...its just sweet and boooooring. It did its job in the airport, making the layovers and accompanying flight bearable, but I dont see it serving well for much more than that.

Thanks for reading!
