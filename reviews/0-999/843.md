**Nose:**  Light, incredibly effervescent. Pears, apples, cream, lemon tart. 

**Taste:** Light here, also. Apples, pears, honey, light baked bread. No real heat, but the proof doesnt appear that high, either. Faint pepper, no oak. 

**Finish:** Short, light, fruity, effervescent. Crisp apples, almost like a buttery chardonnay. No heat at all.
