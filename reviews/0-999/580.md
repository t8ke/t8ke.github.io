**The Schtick:**  Knob Creek Single Barrels have long been a product easily available at most stores. In the last several years, picking private barrels of various ages has become more commonplace. Picks between 9 and 16 years of age have been popping up with great regularity and Ive taken it upon myself to try a variety and see how they fare. Some time ago, Knob Creek exhibited what may have been the largest barrel variation commonly agreed on in the bourbon community with some barrels ranging from wretched to godly. It has been my feeling that, as of late, the overall quality of these barrels being picked has risen, adding a slightly higher floor than existed before. These have all been tried fully blind so as to rank them on their merits, rather than their stats, alone.

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** Day 85

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet buttercream, luxardo cherry, dark cocoa, oak and toffee 

**Taste:**  Thick and sweet. Buttery, almost. Theres some heat here but well balanced according to the proof. Drinks like 50% but its really 60%. Theres loads of caramel here, faint pepper. Toffee is just huge here with nice oaky undertones and some cocoa. No bitterness, which makes me very happy. 

**Finish:** Shorter than otheres but very mild. Oaky caramel without tannic bitterness. Theres some nice cherry here also. This is really a nice finish. 

**Overall:** This is nice and fairly off profile. I dont usually get dark cherry notes in KC but its here and I like it. Balanced with really prominent toffee, caramel and buttery sweetness - this is a win. I wish I had more, because I bet this would make some killer cocktails also. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
