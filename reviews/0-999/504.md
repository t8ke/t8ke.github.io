[**Review #504 | Bourbon Review #287 - Old Grand Dad 114**]( https://t8ke.review/review-504-old-grand-dad-114/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 114pf version of the OGD products released from Beam Suntory. Its regularly available and inexpensive, although brief rumors of its demise came and went, causing taters to buy cases. Thankfully, that was not true, and it sits on every local shelf to this day. 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  57% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Ethanol, caramel, faint peanut brittle. Buttery and sweet. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel but a good deal of heat. Caramel, faint oak, faint astringency. The sweet peanut brittle returns. 

**Finish:** Long and surprisingly mellow. Sweet, buttery caramel is dominant here followed by some astringency and honey roasted peanuts. 

**Overall:** This bottle is an airtime bottle for sure. Over time, air affects it very positively and it opens up to a sweet, peanut brittle bomb. I like it a good deal, but I think the Bottled in Bond product is my favorite of the line.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
