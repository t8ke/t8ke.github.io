[**Review #530 | World Review #14 - Kavalan Solist Ex-Bourbon**]( https://t8ke.review/review-530-kavalan-solist-ex-bourbon-cask/)

**The Schtick:** This is a young, cask strength bottling from Kavalan in Taiwan. This is matured in ex-bourbon casks. 

-----

**Distiller:** Kavalan

**Bottler:** Kavalan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 57.8% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, honey, cream, pears. Pepper, faint strawberry.  

**Taste:** Sweet caramel, oak, pepper, apple, pear. Hot, oaky and spicy. 

**Finish:** Medium length, hot peppers and oaky. Faint fruitiness and a lot of vanilla character here. 

**Overall:** This was my favorite of the three solist that Ive had so far but its still not outstanding whiskey. Theres an odd balance between the finish and the base spirit but I do enjoy being able to actually taste the base spirit here (port and sherry just absolutely dominated the base spirit). This is just fine, but I dont think Ill be jumping through the hoops required to get my paws on this here in the States. 

Thanks for reading!
