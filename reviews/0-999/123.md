**The Schtick:** Hailing from the Texan craft distillery, Brimstone is a peated american whiskey. 

-----

**Distiller:** Balcones

**Bottler:** Balcones

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  53% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Vegetal funky ash, theres smoke. Smells like a hike through St. Helens parks. Smells like I took a nosedive into the aftermath a housefire. It is akin to what I would imagine the inside of my own cremation urn would be like many years from now. 

**Taste:** This tastes like straight fire. I dont mean its hot - its not, it just tastes like I took a scoop of charcoal ash and swallowed it whole. Theres burning pole, burning car, burning peat and some vegetal smokey peat. Have I mentioned its smokey? Some sweetness swings in, but I cant tell if its sherry or port or some other funky oak finish. That would certainly lend to the insanely dark composure of the dram as well. 

**Finish:**  Its long and leaves me with a fear of arson. It burns long into the night and theres some mild mild sweetness here but goodness, its smokey. Long and too hot, but I wonder if Ill taste anything but ash for the next 5 days.

**Overall:** This is bad whiskey and it shouldnt exist. Its as if someone took a good dram and extinguished a cigarette in it.  

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
