[**Review #50 | Rye Review #25 - Willett 3 Year Rye (Willett Distillate)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-50-willett-3yr-willett-distillate-rye/)

**The Schtick:** This is a look at Willetts own rye distillate, aged three years. Unfortunately, I dont have a barrel number on this guy. 

-----

**Distiller:** Willett

**Bottler:** Willett

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 54.5% ABV

**Age:** 3 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich rye spice, vanilla and brown sugar. Gentle for the proof. Good so far...

**Taste:** Pepper, leather and a little musty rye spice. Theres a little funky artificial note in here but I cant tell what it is. Wouldnt have any idea that this was over 100pf though. Overall well blended besides that odd artificial flavor note. Dont know what to make of it. 

**Finish:** Long and gentle, which I really did NOT expect for the youth of this whiskey. I would have no idea this wasnt an older rye and it honestly reminds me a bit of Bourye. I like it. 

**Overall:** This really has done good things for Willet in my eyes. Ive never bought into the hype and $80/90/100+ seems a lot for some of their older (although sourced) ryes I see around me so Ive never bit. This was a great dram and really motivates me to try more Willet product. yum.

Thanks for reading!
