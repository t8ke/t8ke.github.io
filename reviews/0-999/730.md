**The Schtick:** This is a private barrel selection of Knob Creek distillate from Beam / Suntory in Kentucky. It was sent to me blind, and I drank it live in the Whiskey Network Discord and tried to guess the reveal. I have filled in all of the info here post reveal for convenience before posting. 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** The Fridge

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 13 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Brown sugar, honey, tobacco, faint fruitiness, cherry and cocoa.  

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, some heat. Oaky pepper, tobacco, lots of rich cocoa. 

**Finish:** Long, hot but cocoa forward. Pepper and a whole lot of cherry and oak. 

**Overall:** verall: Good but hot. Theres a nice balance between sweetness and the dry oak. Im guessing this is a bourbon around 10-12 years old at 60% ABV - 65% ABV. The cherry note makes me think this is potentially a new batch of ECBP that I havent tried yet. Thats my guess here. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
