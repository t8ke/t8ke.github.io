**The Schtick:** I enjoyed Talisker 10. I enjoyed it quite a bit. One of my issues with brasher scotches is that they occasionally grow quite muted over the years as they get up there in age (looking at you, Laphroaig 18). Lets see how this fares. This is my first time sampling this whiskey, so Im stoked to see what it is about. 

-----

**Distiller:** Talisker

**Bottler:** Talisker 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 45.8% ABV

**Age:** 18 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Caramel, honey, cake, and briney sea air. Mild floral undertones with some melon and vanilla. Its really big on the sweetness and the combination with nice savory salinity. 

**Taste:** Sweet vanilla, lots of salinity. Honey, vanilla and caramel are really big here. Some subtle oak. Its almost like a nice salted caramel dram, without the white chicks a flockin. 

**Finish:** Long and delicious. Vanilla is here and so is the salt and sea air. Little bit of floral orange and lemon peel are more apparent here but it ends long and with quite a bit of complexity.  

**Overall:** Sweet, salty, delicious. Yum. Im a big fan and wish my wallet was bigger.  

Thanks for reading!
