[**Review #813 | Scotch Review #274 - Old Pulteney 12**]( https://t8ke.review/review-813-old-pulteney-12/)

**The Schtick:** First to note, this is a re-review of an old dram I have very much enjoyed. I have enjoyed this and found myself with a duplicate sample because, apparently, sometimes even a spreadsheet is too much work to check. I embrace my blunder, though, and am thrilled to have a chance to re-review something I had a long time ago. I always wonder if my tastes change over time in a significant way, so this seems like a good way to check.

**Distiller:** Old Pulteney 

**Bottler:** Old Pulteney

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, lemon tea, pepper, brine. Vanilla butter cream. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, sweet honey, pears, brine. Salty and sweet. Lots of vanilla, nice apple pie and clove. 

**Finish:** Medium, nice and sweet. Lots of apples, pears, clove, pepper, brine and sweet butter cream.

**Overall:** This is still a winner and, in my opinion, one of the potential best 12yr OB releases. 300 reviews later, its still consistently delicious, and a solid pick.

Thanks for reading!
