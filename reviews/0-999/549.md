[**Review #549 | Bourbon Review #306 - Russells Reserve Single Barrel Bourbon Eagle River Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-549-russells-reserve-single-barrel-bourbon-eagle-river/)

**The Schtick:** Rusells Reserve bourbon is a fairly well aged single barrel release from WT that is bottled at 55% ABV. This sample came in a swap well after my Gobble Til You Wobble Series which was nice. That was a lot of turkey.  The break in between was refreshing.

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** Eagle River

**ABV:**  55% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Calssic turkey spice and cinnamon. Caramel, clove and some faint orange zest. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, some heat. Caramel, clove and pepper and dominant notes. Lots of allspice. 

**Finish:** Medium length, hot and oaky. Orange is here with caramel, pepper and dry tannins. 

**Overall:** Overall, this was nice but far from remarkable. Its a standard, on-profile gobbler - which is never bad, but often not particularly exciting either. What it does, it does well. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
