[**Review #264 | Scotch Review #264 - Oban 14yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-264-oban-14yr/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Oban

**Bottler:** Oban

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Salted caramel, doughy sweet and yeasty bakery notes. Cinnamon, molasses, mild smokey char (very mild) and a bit of toffee and vanilla.

**Taste:**  Odd, funky sweetness - tastes like a 75% baked pastry. I like it. More salted caramel notes, creme brulee, molasses, vanilla, mild cinnamon, some faint char and a good oak note.

**Finish:** Medium length, a tad hot for the proof. Its unique and nice and complex with honey, ginger, very very faint sea air and a good dose of vanilla.

**Overall:** This is a unique dram and I really enjoyed it. Its certainly different from most anything else in Diageos core line (save for Dalwhinnie, its oddly reminiscent in part to some of the standard Dalwhinnie notes) and I found myself enjoying it a good bit. Im going to give it a Rank 6 for these reasons. There is one unfortunate note though - this bottle is consistently nearing $75-$80 where I live and thats just painful to see. Id buy this all of the time at $45-$55 but an expensive $25 hike in price just cant be justified.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
