**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Tobermory

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  56% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Dirt, sherry, fruit, plum, forest fire, very mineral heavy and oddly field like (more grassy than floral)

**Taste:** Oily mouth feel and instantly smokey. Kind of an oatmeal note. Sherry is very prominent with fig, date, plum. Apples, raspberry jam. Burning things - very mineral heavy and very woody. Not ashy but a very strong forest note with wood and smoke and herbal grassy peat. Like a goddamn forest fire. This is really something else

**Finish:** Long, thick and rich. full of smoke but also well blended with the added complexity of the sherry.

**Overall:** This is crazy unique and also crazy good. Im really enjoying how the peat here is presented - very prominent and different from other big peat bombs. The sherry plays along very very well and makes the dram thick, rich and syrupy. All in all, Im a fan. Im giving this a Rank 7 and Im now feeling an urge to pick up a bottle.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
