**The Schtick:** This is a single barrel of Wild Turkey distillate that was picked and bottled by Single Cask Nation. 

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Single Cask Nation | Jewish Whisky Company

**Selection:** Single Cask Nation

**ABV:**  61% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Rich maple, toffee, tobacco, oak, pipe tobacco, thick molasses, allspice. Faint orange peel. Very rich butter cream.

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Bitter oak, cocoa, caramel, orange peel, pepper, allspice, butter cream, Werthers caramel and musty tobacco. 

**Finish:** Long, some heat, bitter earthiness. Caramel, pepper, clove. Earthy tobacco.

**Overall:** Very good. The combination of age, proof and apparent barrel selection combines to leave us with a nice sample here. The price is hard to swallow, but it lines up with a large variety of very good Russells Reserve Single Barrels quality wise.

Thanks for reading!
