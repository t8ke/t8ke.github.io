**The Schtick:** This is an Oloroso sherry finished American brandy made from apple distillate. Named for the floodwalls that keep Kentucky dry from heavy rains. 

-----

**Distiller:** Copper and Kings

**Bottler:** Copper and Kings       

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Lots going on here, syrupy fruit like apples, pears, faint melon. Theres some nice vanilla and then a whole lot of dry spice like pepper, cocoa, even a hint of tobacco.  

**Taste:** Nice mouthfeel and the proof feels just about right. Theres typical brandy sweetness, with a preference towards the fruity ends of things - more apple, some concord grap, pear, honeydew but then the sherry sweeps in with some nice pepper, faint sulfur, dry oak and some cocoa. I was concerned finishing something sweet with something sweet would cause big problems here but the choice of Oloroso was a good one - the dry tannis Oloroso character balances the syrupy sweet apple brandy distillate here very well. 

**Finish:** Long and well balanced - fruit and spice are here and are very complex.  

**Overall:** This is a home run for Copper and Kings, especially at the price point it sits at (price not taken into account for review score, though). The proof is right, the flavor is really great and its a distinctive look at some top notch experimenting going on in American Brandy right now. 

Thanks for reading!
