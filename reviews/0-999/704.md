**The Schtick:**  This is a cask strength, single barrel release from Four Roses, featuring their OBSV recipe.

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses   

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** Bourbon Brigante

**ABV:** 62.8% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Clove, toffee, vanilla, allspice, pepper, caramels and sweet melon. Floral, sweet, spicy. Nice complexity here. 

**Taste:** Medium, some heat, rich cocoa, honey, vanilla, floral fruits and pepper. Strong oaky backbone. Really diverse, and the cocoa is surprisingly prominent. The oak is a bit heavy handed though and it starts to dive into the dirt near the end. 

**Finish:** Oak, tobacco, dry earthy pepper.

**Overall:** Too dry and oaky, spicy for my tastes. I was a little surprises since OBSV doesnt usually come across ths dry to me, but this was an outlier for sure.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
