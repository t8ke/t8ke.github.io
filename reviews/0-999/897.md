**The Schtick:** This is a single barrel selection of Knob Creek Rye that is barreled and then bottled at cask strength.

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** Ace 

**ABV:** 57.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Clove, tobacco, thick and rich with loads of baking spices, gingerbread and tiramisu. Sweet, but more savory and focused on spices here. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, some heat, clove and tobacco. Pepper, oak, some vanilla and cocoa. Light fruitiness, lots of herbal spice also. 

**Finish:** Medium length, some clove, pepper, oak and herbal essence. More dry and spicy than sweet. 

**Overall:** I like this but it strays a bit too oaky and spicy, as well as being pretty dry to climb higher than a 6.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
