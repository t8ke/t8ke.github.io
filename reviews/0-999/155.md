[**Review #155 | Scotch Review #59 - Bunnahabhain 12yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-155-bunnahabhain-12yr/)

**The Schtick:** This is an age stated release in Bunnas core line. Ive had many of their IBs but never reviewed the OBs. Time for everything, I suppose. 

-----

**Distiller:** Bunnahabhain

**Bottler:** Bunnahabhain

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 46.3% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet honey, grain and dough. Mild fruity sweet, some thin sherry. Mild saltiness, not quite seaside briney but theres a little bit of salt. Some more honey. 

**Taste:** Mild sherry fruits like raisin and date and fig, salt and hay. Grassy with the tiniest hint of a little char. Some strawberry and raspberry towards the end. 

**Finish:** Medium and not at all hot despite the wee higher proof. Its a great balance of sweet and savory.  

**Overall:** I didnt really know what to expect from the standard 12yr OB expression. Heavily sherried Bunna is my jam though and its cool to see what that all is based around. Yum.

Thanks for reading!
