[**Review #773 | Bourbon Review #427 - Four Roses Single Barrel Discount Liquors Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-773-four-roses-single-barrel-obsv-discount-liquors-selection/)

**The Schtick:** This is a rare, but growing ever increasingly less so, single barrel Four Roses bottling for a local Wisconsin liquor chain. As time progresses, we are seeing more and more 7-9 year, 50% ABV OBSV picks being doled out to stores and this is one of them. Lets see how it stacks up. 

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses 

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** Discount Liquors

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Caramel, clove, honey, rich tobacco, cocoa and some token Four Roses clove and pepper. Really rich nose, overall. 

**Taste:** Medium - rich mouthfeel, caramel and pepper. Lots of tobacco and a strong oak presence. Sweet cream, clove and cocoa rounds out the palate. 

**Finish:** Medium length, no heat. Sweet caramel, cocoa and vanilla. A really vibrant fruitiness here plays well with some confectioners sugar and some nice oak character.

**Overall:** This store has had its ups and downs in the past but I thought this was something really impressive. I was concerned that getting a Single Barrel rather than a Private Selection would be a bit of a downgrade but that wasnt the case at all. Very nice. 

Thanks for reading!
