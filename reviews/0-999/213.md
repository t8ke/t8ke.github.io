[**Review #213 | Bourbon Review #122 - Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve Bourbon Schnapps Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-213-kc-sib-schnapps-pick/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** Schnapps

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Hearty peanut brittle, caramel, toffee and huge clove and cinnamon. Smells hot but also smells like a good dead of winter dram.

**Taste:** Hot but thick and sweet. Funky beam funk, lots of peanut brittle, oak, toffee and caramel. Heavy woodiness and spice also.

**Finish:**  Long and hot but not unbearably so. At 60% theres no getting around the heat. Sweet and really complex. I put this with other picks - all are slightly different but generally about the same in terms of quality.

**Overall:** To me this is baby Bookers and it delivers very well. This bottle is age stated 9 years so really it should be big Bookers, but the flavor in Bookers is just right to me. Delicious and consistent.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
