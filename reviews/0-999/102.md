[**Review #102 | Scotch Review #38 - Auchentoshan Valinch 2012**]( https://t8ke.review/review-102-auchentoshan-valinch-2012/)

**The Schtick:** This is a yearly cask strength release from Auchentoshan. 

-----

**Distiller:** Auchentoshan

**Bottler:** Auchentoshan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 57.1% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla and some strong wood noted followed by wine and what smells like grape PX sweetness. Sugary, syrupy and thick on the fruit. I dont think this is a wine finished whiskey but damn does it smell like it.

**Taste:** Thicker on the tongue than I expected, theres some atringent plastics, some wine and gruity sweetness and a bit of thick cream. Someone make a dick joke, I dare you. Its pretty delicious overall but would be truly amazing if not for that bitter astringent plasticy note.

**Finish:** Long but hot. Artificially sweet and thick and lots of plastic.

**Overall:** The tail end of the tasting notes and the finish really cripple it. I like that it is cask strength and sort of unique but the taste just cant hold up.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
