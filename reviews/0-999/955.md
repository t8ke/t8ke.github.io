-----

**Distiller:** Glen Scotia

**Bottler:** Samaroli

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** 21 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich, funky caramel. Pungent, meaty funk. Lots of stewed fruits, fresh baked bread, thick tobacco. The complexity is impressive. Butterscotch candy. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No heat. Salted caramel chocolate, rich stewed fruits. Its funky, almost meaty here also. Not as brash as a Port Charlotte, but the peat is well integrated. Pepper, salt, caramel, fresh baked bread. Faint ash and maritime air. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length, rich and complex. More caramel and butterscotch here. Less peat and smoke than in the palate, with more stewed fruits showing up as well.

**Overall:** Rich and complex, this was a really great showing from Glen Scotia. Well picked, Samaroli.

Thanks for reading!
