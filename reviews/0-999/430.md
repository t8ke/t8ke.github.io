[**Review #430 | AmericanBrandy Review #1 - Copper and Kings Butchertown**]( https://t8ke.review/review-430-copper-and-kings-butchertown/)

**The Schtick:** Copper and Kings is a relatively fresh upstart in the American distilling game. Based in Kentucky, they dont produce bourbon, though. They produce American brandy via copper pot stills. I think they make pretty good product, and wanted to review this since Im at the end of my bottle. Just a note, too, is that Ill be condensing and posting armagnac and cognac reviews under the "Brandy" tag also, unless there is major outcry. S

**Distiller:** Copper and Kings

**Bottler:** Copper and Kings

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  62% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**   Syrupy fruit, mildly oaky. Youthful astringency with some mild ethanol but a large dose of creamy vanilla makes up for this. Lots of apple, pear, raspberry, cocoa, vanilla and a nice hint of tobacco. 

**Taste:** Thick and oily mouthfeel. Sweet but not cloying, fruity bouquet balanced well with some oak and vanilla. Its very jammy and rich, with some clove, cinnamon and maple balancing, also. 

**Finish:** Long and mild despite the proof. Very rich but not cloying sweet. 

**Overall:** This is a great take on American brandy and the fact that is it NCA and NCF is also a really nice touch. This is especially great neat but also makes a killer brandy manhattan or old fashioned. 

Thanks for reading!
