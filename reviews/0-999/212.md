[**Review #212 | Rye Review #121 - Hochstadters Vatted Straight Rye Whiskey**]( https://t8ke.review/review-212-hochstadters-vatted-rye/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Hochstadters

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Clove and lots of cinnamon. Rainy vanilla, gingerbread and a good deal of metallic rye spice. Theres some dusty leather. Overall, this is not a sweet rye. There is also virtually no "mintyness" to speak of.

**Taste:** Mildly fruity, lots of clove and a great deal of heavy rye spice. Oddly astringent and what little sweetness appeared in the nose is completely gone. Becomes bitter.

**Finish:**  Medium and mildly hot but not unreasonably so. Very spicy with a good deal of astringency.

**Overall:** Honestly, I started liking this bottle but over time it really failed to appeal to me. It doesnt do anything in my opinion that Ritt Rye cant do and while its good for the price, I dont really see myself rushing to buy another bottle soon. Theres Ritt rye on my shelf for cheap rye nights and SAOS/HW Rendezvous rye on my shelf for nice sipping rye. To me, this rye doesnt sit in a category that really needs to belong. That being said, its under $30 and theres really no risk in giving it a shot if youre curious. Im not disappointed or lamenting over the fact that I bought a bottle. For all of those reasons, Im giving this dram a 5 - its perfectly fine. Not amazing but also not awful. For a $25-$30 rye, it could be doing far, far worse.

Thanks for reading!
