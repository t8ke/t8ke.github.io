[**Review #506 | Bourbon Review #288 - Wyoming Whiskey Outryder Bottled in Bond**]( https://t8ke.review/review-506-wyoming-whiskey-outryder-bib/)

**The Schtick:** This is a bonded product from Wyoming Whiskey

-----

**Distiller:** Wyoming Whiskey

**Bottler:** Wyoming Whiskey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet honey, cinnamon, ginger. Its very floral, and nicely sweet as well. No big red flags in the nose that this is an overly young craft product.

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel. Lots of nice honey and caramel. No real heat. Faint fruitiness, sweet butter cream and lots of floral notes. Faint cardamom. 

**Finish:** Medium length, some funk and some faint astringency.

**Overall:** This was so close to knocking it out of the park. Nose was great. Palate was great. Finish was meh. I really enjoyed it though and I thought this is a stellar attempt by Wymoning. I look forward to trying other, potentially older expressions, to see if they can iron out that finish with age. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
