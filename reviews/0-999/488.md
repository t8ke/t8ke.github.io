[**Review #488 | Scotch Review #176 - Johnnie Walker Gold Label Reserve**]( https://t8ke.review/review-488-johnnie-walker-gold-label-reserve/)

**The Schtick:** This is the re-release of the previously age stated Gold Label from Johnnie Walker

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Johnnie Walker

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet caramel, cake. Malty cereal, faint sea breeze. 

**Taste:** Think mouthfeel but no heat. Sweet vanilla, cake, mild apple pear. Faint brine, butter cream and the faintest hint of some smoke. 

**Finish:** Medium length. Gentle smoke, pepper, sea breeze. Lemon butter cream, cake-y notes. Overall its sweet, faintly briney and smokey. 

**Overall:** Not the most complex thing in the world, but surprisingly complex for a Walker. I think the Green is still my favorite so far, but this wasnt half bad. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
