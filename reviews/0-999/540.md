[**Review #540 | Bourbon Review #304 - Wild Turkey Rare Breed 116.8**]( https://t8ke.review/review-540-wild-turkey-rare-breed-2017-1168/)

**The Schtick:** This is the latest batched iteration of Wild Turkeys Rare Breed. Based on how long WT RB 03 was around, who knows how long we can expect to this on the market also. 

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 58.4% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Huge clove, spicey allspice and sweet musty caramel. Caramel and vanilla are present here also, although they are hidden away behind the big, powerful spices. 

**Taste:** Thin/medium mouthfeel. Heat, pepper, spice. Pretty thin, not super rich, all things considered. Theres some more caramel, faint tobacco and nougat, but its all pretty muted. 

**Finish:** Medium length, mild heat and astringency. Brown sugar dominates with faint pepper. 

**Overall:** Swing and a......whiff. 99 was easily the best of the RB in my opinion and that is no different. I didnt love 03 but I remember thinking it was slightly better to on par with this. This just isnt great - its spice driven and muted which means it will be an easy pass on the shelf for me. 

Thanks for reading!
