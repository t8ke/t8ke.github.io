-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  68% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Oak, honey, cola. Big toffee, rich pepper. Some tobacco. Definitely a big, bold bourbon focusing on more savory, wood driven notes. 

**Taste:** Thick, rich mouth feel. Definite heat, but not punishing. Toffee, cola, rich oak. Pepper, tobacco, light cherry. Cocoa, light vanilla cream. Super rich. 

**Finish:** Long, rich, with some heat. Lots of oak here, but not too drying or tannic. Cherries, cola, caramel and tobacco reign supreme here. 

**Overall:** This was another great batch in what is becoming an incredibly consistent product line. Its oaky and bold without being too dry or tannic and there is a bouquet of other really enjoyable flavors to boot. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
