**The Schtick:**  This is from a cask at Laphroaigs Distillery that was hand filled. It was bottled in 2018 after being distilled and barreled in 2006 and spent the entirety of its life in an ex-bourbon cask. It is bottled at cask strength, with no coloring or filtering. It was aged in warehouse 8. Due to the cask number, Laphroaig refers to this cask as the Devils Cask, which makes this the Devils Dram. 

-----

**Distiller:** Laphroaig

**Bottler:** Laphroaig

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  58% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich, oily, phenols. Vanilla butter cream, rich peat and earthy smoke. Burning rubber, rotting fish and bandages. Rich charcoal smoke, some meaty notes and a bit of lemon zest.  

**Taste:** Thick, rich, brash. Sweet honey, rich vanilla, succulent lemon meringue. Then storms the smoke. Theres some ethanol, but not too much. Burning logs, rotting fish, and rich umami. Bandages, burning rubber, brash and raw phenol covers the sweetness and turns this into an ash bomb. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and smoky. Theres more focus on burning logs, burning tires and chemical smoke. Theres some cocoa, some toffee, some buttered popcorn and a final smoky finish that lasts for ages. 

**Overall:** This is phenomenal. Brash, powerful, complex. Cask number aside, this would truly be a great cask to refer to the Devils Dram, because the smoke is overpowering and rich, blending well with the other sweeter notes. Im a fan. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
