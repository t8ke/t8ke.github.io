**The Schtick:** This is batch #58 of Amrut Fusion, released in April of 2017. Amrut is an Indian (think country) distillery that has seen much wider distribution here in the US in the last couple of years. This is my first review of their products, although not my first brush, so lets dive in. It is distilled from Indian and Scottish barley.

**Distiller:** Amrut

**Bottler:** Amrut

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Malty, wet grass, mildly lactic. Some anise, wet cardboard, honey. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Mild heat. Sweet, malty, some caramel. Pepper, wet cardboard. Faint clove, rubber and some interesting but mild smokiness. 

**Finish:** Short, sweet and peppery. I cant tell if there is a lot of rubber here or some mild smoke presence, but its a fairly short finish without a lot going on. That said, there are no young gross notes here and the sweet and pepper play well. 

**Overall:** Sort of young, a little hot, generally unremarkable but recovers in the finish.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
