**The Schtick:** This is the final phase of Gobble Til You Wobble and Ill be looking at both the Bourbon and Ryes that are sold under that line. Bourbons first, ryes second. This is a modern offering from Wild Turkey with the higher entry proof. It is diluted to 104 pf and sold as a single barrel offering across the nation. Many stores have been able to do picks of these products, and extra information is available as a result. It is, still, a NAS product, though.

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** AL State

**ABV:**  52% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet cream, rye spice. Creamy vanilla, toffee, almost some faint root beer. Fruity and very complex. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich - no heat. Sweet creamy rye spice. Fruity - like a caramel apple, cocoa and toffee are here also. The balance here is really great - sweet, creamy, spice - all balanced. Each aspect is very well integrated without being too overbearing. One of my biggest Alberta complaints is too fruity, not enough spicy. This nails that balance, for instance.

**Finish:**  Long sweet and spicy. Rye spice, cloves, faint pepper. Caramel apple is back with some nice toffee and creamy vanilla also. Some faint heat and astringency, but nothing disastrous. 

**Overall:** This is really great - its complex and well balanced. I love the diversity of the notes and Im a fan of how they balance. 

Thanks for reading!
