[**Review #713 | Bourbon Review #402 - Wyoming Whiskey Waterford Wines Private Stock Barrel 1631**]( https://t8ke.review/review-713-wyoming-whiskey-waterford-wines-private-stock-barrel-1631/)

**The Schtick:** This is a private bottling of Wyoming Whiskeys distillate. It is 5 years old, bottled at cask strength, and bottled for Waterford Wines, a local Wisconsin retailer of wine and spirits. 

-----

**Distiller:** Wyoming Whiskey 

**Bottler:** Wyoming Whiskey 

**Selection:** Waterford Wine

**ABV:** 55.7% ABV

**Age:** 5 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Super fruity. Bubblegum, cotton candy, melon, honey dew, orange, cantaloupe and musty wet sawdust. The fruitiness here is off of the charts.

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, grassy and floral. Lots of honey. Wet cardboard, melon, pepper and clove. Big, bold, orange essence. Bitter rubber.

**Finish:** Short, hot, lemon, melon, orange and wet cardboard. 

**Overall:** This was super interesting, but didnt really tickle my fancy. The youth is evident and the super pervasive fruitiness was interesting but not enjoyable for me. I really enjoyed Wyomings Bottled in Bond, so Im going to chalk this up to youth and cask deviation. 

Thanks for reading!
