[**Review #130 | Scotch Review #53 - Bruichladdich Octomore 7.2**]( https://t8ke.review/review-130-octomore-72/)

**The Schtick:** Aged 5 years in a combination of American Oak and Syrah casks. Peated to 208ppm. I dont particularly agree with their method of labeling peat intensity by the ppm, but its an interesting number they choose to include and I wont poo-poo more information rather than less.

**Distiller:** Bruichladdich

**Bottler:** Bruichladdich

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 66.7% ABV

**Age:** 5 Years

**Nose:**  Lemon zest, meringue pie. Theres moss, brine and then a massive wall of peat smoke. More brine storms in, followed by a bit more fruits and bbq notes. Lemons, pears, apricot and some really pleasant apple all balance with some icing notes to complement the smoke and brine.

**Taste:** Salty and fruity. I love the balance of sweet and savory, its like a BBQ turned up to 11 steeped in lemon-apple sauce. Theres a nice, solid side of icing sweetness. Its very rich and complex which surprised me for a young whiskey, but it is delicious. Everything is balanced very well without trivializing a specific note. 

**Finish:**  Long, fruity and peaty. Its hot, but not punishing, and carries on with lemon and brine for quite a while. Frankly, I know Octo is known for huge peat but this is one of the best balances of peat and other savory flavors. Very well done. 

**Overall:** Octo delivers. I think theyre a bit overpriced but I dont regret buying the 7.4 I got, and for what this bottle goes for, I doubt I would regret this either. Every note is huge and in your face without being overwhelming and its a very well done blend of peat, smoke, brine and sweet fruits and desserts. Absolutely delicious. 

Thanks for reading!
