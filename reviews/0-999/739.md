**The Schtick:** This is a single malt distilled at Bertrand (France). It is just a hair (about a week) under 9 years old, and is a single cask bottling under the Uberach label. 

-----

**Distiller:** Bertrand

**Bottler:** Uberach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 48.4% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Malty, bran flakes, oats, caramel. Nice toffee, with some cocoa here. Rich and sticky, but malty.   

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, no real heat. Fruity with some nice oak presence. Confectioners sugar. Faint grape? Interesting. Its really musty though and comes with some interesting earthiness. 

**Finish:** Short but not hot, musty and sweet. Faintly fruity, nice oak presence but earthy pepper paired with the mustiness is an interesting blend. 

**Overall:** I liked the earthy, peppery character in this release, but found the musty, damp cereal notes to be a little forward here. The oak integration was nice, as was the caramel and fruitiness, but the mustiness seemed to bury all of those things a tad. If it were scaled back a bit, I could easily see this climbing much higher. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
