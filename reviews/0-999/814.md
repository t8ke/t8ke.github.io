[**Review #814 | Bourbon Review #442 - Kings County Bourbon**]( https://t8ke.review/review-814-kings-county-bourbon-whiskey/)

**The Schtick:** "Kings County Distillerys Straight Bourbon is made from New York State organic corn and malted barley from the U.K., is twice distilled in copper pot stills and then aged in new charred oak barrels.  It is characterized by a rich aroma of fresh corn, balanced with the sweet caramelized oak sap from small barrels.  It has a very strong sweet base with flavors of vanilla and caramel, a deep molasses taste to the middle notes, and leaves a smooth finish with hints of cinnamon and autumn spices. Aged for at least two years, this bourbon is a precocious whiskey, surprisingly robust for its age." - Kings County website.

**Distiller:** Kings County Distillery

**Bottler:** Kings County Distillery

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Wet cardboard, grassy, musty, sickly fake sweet.

**Taste:** Thin, musty, cardboard, sour lactic, repulsive.

**Finish:** Short, hot, grows sweeter, more vile, crafty, green wet grass. 

**Overall:** Repulsive. I didnt have high hopes for this given what I read from their site, but this was significantly worse than even I expected. They have a lot of work to do before they begin to compete with what I consider to even be the bad producers. Avoid at all costs. 

Thanks for reading!
