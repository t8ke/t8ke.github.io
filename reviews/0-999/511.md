[**Review #511 | Bourbon Review #293 - Barton 1792 Port Finish**]( https://t8ke.review/review-511-1792-port-finish/)

**The Schtick:** This is a port finished bourbon produced by Barton. 

-----

**Distiller:** Barton

**Bottler:** Barton

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 44.45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet jam, stewed fruits. Vanilla, honey, caramel. Faint cocoa. Its mostly all sweet. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, sweet and fruity. No heat. Lots of stewed fruits here as well as a jammy dessert set of notes like cocoa, vanilla, confectioners sugar, some faint tobacco. Theres no bitterness and its all sweet. 

**Finish:** Short, no heat. Sweet whisp of strawberry preserve and then its gone. 

**Overall:** Overall, this is really interesting. I love the palate and the nose as a good dessert but the finish is fairly disappointing. Id honestly probably buy a bottle if it were on shelves, just to have around when the sweet tooth hits. Its not super remarkable, though. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
