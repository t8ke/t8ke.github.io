**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Glenfarclas

**Bottler:** Glenfarclas

**Selection:** Astor

**ABV:** 57.4% ABV

**Age:** 25 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Big pear, sweet cream, pound cake. Theres definitely sherry notes in here also, some light fig, plum, raspberry, mild mild cocoa. The integration and balance are wonderful.

**Taste:** Thick, rich, mouthfeel. For the proof, there is no astringency. Sweet, creamy, definitely Glenfarclas spirit. Buttery and doughy. Mild sulfurous, some clove and cocoa before the sherry fruits roll in modestly. This is nothing like the massive sherry bomb that was the 24yr KL pick I also recently finished. Its balanced, complex, sweet but not cloying. This is a beautiful example that not every sherry dram needs to blow your head off with sherry.

**Finish:** Long, wonderfully sweet. Great length but the proof is very kind here. Sweet, doughy, lightly fruity as it departs. Wonderful.

**Overall:** I split this bottle three ways with a couple local buds, but I regret putting my greed aside. Im not sure Id rebuy at the price, but it was phenomenal and I think it was well worth it. I just happen to not be swimming in money like Scrooge McDuck. Overall, this dram is complex and touches on so many notes I just absolutely love to see in a scotch. Im giving this a Rank 8.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
