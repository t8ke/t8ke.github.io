[**Review #32 | Scotch Review #11 - Highland Park 12**]( https://t8ke.review/review-32-highland-park-12yr/)

**The Schtick:** This is the youngest age stated release in Highland Parks core line of whiskeys. 

-----

**Distiller:** Highland Park

**Bottler:** Highland Park

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  At first sniff it seems very similar to JW Black in a subdued manner. At second sniff, theres more vanilla, a little more smoke and a bit more complexity. 

**Taste:** The mouthfeel is solid, coats nicely. Theres a bit of smoke, followed by a hint of sweetness and vanilla. I really like the smoke here without a lot of peat, although its not overpowering. Im not getting much more than vanilla, some charred wood and smoke. Thats the opposite of a problem though, I like it. 

**Finish:** The finish is a bit shorter than the Glendronach but its not harsh, abrasive or short lived. Its a little bit lower on the ABV, which I attribute some of this to. Theres a little smoke on the finish.

**Overall:** I didnt really know what to expect from this. For a dram I did 0 research about ahead of time, Im pleasantly surprised. Its complex and well integrated. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
