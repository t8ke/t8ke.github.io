[**Review #67 | Bourbon Review #37 - Stagg Jr. Batch 1**]( https://t8ke.review/review-67-stagg-jr-batch-1/)

**The Schtick:** Stagg Jr is made from the same mashbill as the Buffalo Trace Antique Collections George T. Stagg product. This is aged "almost ten years" per the label and is bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 67.2% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Cloves, cinnamon, molasses and chocolate. Some vanilla in there too. Surprising lack of alcohol given the proof. 

**Taste:** The palate is quite hot. Theres vanilla, cinnamon and a little chocolate but its well hidden under the heat. A splash of water reigns this in a bit. It improves a ton. Alone though, its punishing. 

**Finish:** Long, but hot. Honestly, what flavor I might have extracted is pretty well buried. Once again, a splash of water reveals a thick exit with cream and vanilla and molasses. Much better. 

**Overall:** This is undoubtedly the first attempt from BT on this release. Its painfully clear (pun intended). With water, this bottle really, really shines and is delicious. Dont let the lack of a nose fool you there, that 134.4 proof is right there ready to beat you in the face. 

Thanks for reading!
