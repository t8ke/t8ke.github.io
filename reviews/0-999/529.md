[**Review #529 | Rum Review #13 - Stolen Overproof 6yr Jamaican Hampden Rum**]( https://t8ke.review/review-529-stolen-overproof-6yr-hampden/)

**The Schtick:** This is an independently bottled release of 6yr, pot still, Hampden rum. It is bottled by "Stolen" which is a hip, trendy, marketing buzzword laden operation being run in the USA. The label encourages you to "Drink it like its stolen"...whatever that means. 

-----

**Distiller:** Hampden

**Bottler:** Stolen

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 61.5% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Massive ester blast. Honey, caramel, molasses, meaty BBQ, rich overripe fruits (namely banana, mango, plantain, pineapple). Absolutely loaded with that Hampden funk. Bit of ethanol.

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, mild heat for the proof. Sweet fruits, molasses, more overripe fruits, some meatiness here also. Pairs nice with notes of clove and allspice. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and rich. Lots of estery funk here blended with brown sugar and sweetness.  

**Overall:** Overall, this is a great product. Its young, its brash and it lives up to all of the things I like about Hampden. This is phenomenal neat and also makes a great cocktail. Its well worth looking past the marketing garbage on the bottle/website and enjoying this for what it is: good rum. 

Thanks for reading!
