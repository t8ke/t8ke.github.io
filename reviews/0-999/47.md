[**Review #47 | Bourbon Review #24 - Evan Williams Single Barrel 2006**]( https://t8ke.review/review-47-evan-williams-single-barrel-2006-re-review-2/)

**The Schtick:** This is a single barrel offering from Evan Williams.

-----

**Distiller:** Evan Williams

**Bottler:** Evan Williams

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 43.3% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Light sweetness and vanilla, some peanut which is much stronger here than in the Bookers I recently reviewed. Some earthy notes followed by a little maple.

**Taste:** Some woody sweetness, some vanilla and spice and then some funky leather/oak notes. I like it a lot. 

**Finish:** Its a little short and a little one trick pony but some peanuts funk, sugar and a little wood mingle away.  

**Overall:** Not bad. There are a lot of enjoyable notes here. New vintages are being released all the time, so it will be interesting to compare as more pop up. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
