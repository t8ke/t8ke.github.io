**The Schtick:** This is a Cadenheads blend of two 28 year old Linkwood casks that are ex-sherry provenance. It is bottled at cask strength, with no filtering or coloring, under the Cadenheads IB banner. 

-----

**Distiller:** Linkwood

**Bottler:** Cadenheads

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 58.4% ABV

**Age:** 28 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, very prominent melon. Sour, lactic fruits. Lightly bread-y. Faint brine, varnish. If someone blinded me on this one, Id guess unpeated Bruichladdich. The fruity, lactic, sour notes are striking, and something Ive not yet experienced with a Linkwood. 

**Taste:** Honey, melons, pepper, oak, sour milk. The mouth feel is nice. Some smoke rolls in, faint brine. More oak here than on the nose, but boy its hot for the proof. Oddly lacking in the sherry fruits division.

**Finish:** Long, hot, lots of vanilla, berries, oak, and pepper. Faint smoke here also.

**Overall:** I wish I was more of a fan of this, but it was sort of all over the place and features some really strange pairings of notes. The sour milk, bitter fruits, and the general disjointed nature was strange. 

Thanks for reading!
