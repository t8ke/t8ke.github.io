[**Review #715 | Bourbon Review #403 - Basil Haydens 8yr Bourbon**]( https://t8ke.review/review-715-basil-haydens-8yr-bourbon/)

**The Schtick:** This is an old release of the modern Basil Haydens expression from Beam/Suntory. It carries an 8yr age statement and it is bottled at 40% ABV

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Honey, toffee, peanut brittle. Honey roasted peanuts, floral young corn, vanilla. 

**Taste:** Thin, no heat. Sweet with vanilla, caramel and honey roasted peanuts. 

**Finish:** Short finish, no heat, sweet caramel, young corn and peanut brittle.

**Overall:** This isnt half bad, better than modern Basils, in my opinion, but not great. Its real thin throughout, and while the flavors arent overtly negative, there is definite youth, even for an 8 year product. That said, Im impressed compared to what Ive had of Basils in the past, and that aint half bad.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
