[**Review #832 | Bourbon Review #448 - Hayes Parker Bourbon**]( https://t8ke.review/review-832-hayes-parker-bourbon/)

**The Schtick:** This is a Total Wine house brand that is sourced from TerraPURE in the Carolinas - a company that "hyper ages" distills products by attempting to age them faster than conventionally possible using a proprietary method. They claim that this process will revolutionize the industry by providing producers with products that are comparable to well aged bourbons and ryes, in just a fraction of that time. Lets see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** TerraPURE

**Bottler:** TerraPURE for Total Wine

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** .5 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Wet cardboard, vanilla, wet wood, grass, dirt, mold

**Taste:** Sickeningly sweet, musty, craft, wet cardboard, lactic vomit

**Finish:** Nonexistent, hot, rough, sickeningly sweet, musty

**Overall:** This is the bottom of the proverbial barrel. It is revolting. This is so much worse than just about any other craft spirit Ive tried, save for unlucky few.

Thanks for reading!
