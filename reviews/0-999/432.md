[**Review #432 | Bourbon Review #245 - Four Roses OBSQ Binnys Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-432-four-roses-obsq-binnys/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses 

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** Binnys

**ABV:** 58.4% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Muted floral honey, cocoa, toffee and some confectioners sugar.  

**Taste:**  Rich, very little heat despite the proof. Floral, melons, berries, cocoa and toffee 

**Finish:** Medium in length, very sweet and fruit / caramel forward. 

**Overall:** This is far from a bad pick but it felt pretty one-dimensional to me. Im used to a little more complexity from Four Roses PS bottlings but I still enjoyed this a bit more than an average dram. Will be hoping for better on Binnys next round of OBSQ picks (no, I dont know when those will be). 

Thanks for reading!
