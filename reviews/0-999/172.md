**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Dalmore

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 19 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Plums, grapes and figs. Theres some sweet toffee and a bit of butterscotch candy. Light strawberry jam. Theres some faint wood char and a hair of fudge. Dark chocolate, the real kind. True dark sweets. 

**Taste:** Sweet malty cereal. Plums and strawberry jam. Theres a good deal of sherry funk here too. Reminds me a good deal of the funk from a Signatory Mortlach I had a while back. Its oily and sweet though, very satisfying sherry overall. 

**Finish:** Medium but entirely gentle. No ethanol but the funk intensifies and some raspberry preserve gets thrown in with all of the other fruit and fudge. A great dessert dram. 

**Overall:** I like Signatory and I think they make generally impressive picks. This guy falls nearer the bottom of my list of Signatorys in terms of rating but theres nothing bad to be said. Its sweet and theres definitely sherry. Its fudgey and complex. Its squarely a cut above an average dram and therefore I give it a 6. With the new scale, this means that Dalmore 19yr Sherry Cask lives happily with other drams like Macallan 12, Scapa 16, Glengoyne 12 and Bruichladdich Waves from my archive. Thanks for reading! 

Thanks for reading!
