[**Review #4 | Bourbon Review #4 - Door County Single Malt**]( https://t8ke.review/review-4-door-county-single-malt/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Door County Distillery

**Bottler:** Door County Distillery

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sugar, molasses and a huge floral punch

**Taste:** Like shoving your face in a bouquet, the sweetness almost totally vanishes in lieu of a huge floral flavor. 

**Finish:** Sugary sweetness shows up a little bit, with a little vanilla. 

**Overall:** Not bad, not sure its worth the $20/350ml price but Im always willing to give something local a shot every now and again; Im not overly disappointed. Im giving this a Rank 4. Its not amazingly complex, or delicious. Its just kind of there. A thin, sweet floral dram with no real complexity.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
