**The Schtick:** This is another named single barrel, bottled at cask strength, as part of the Distillers Drawers releases at Privateer distilling in Ipswitch, MA. 

-----

**Distiller:** Privateer

**Bottler:** Privateer

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 55.1% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Really rich melon, cinnamon buns, faintly funky fruits. Molasses, almost a rich cheese note.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, rich caramel. Molasses. Sweet and creamy, faint bananas foster. Mild heat, very in check. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and rich. No plastic-y notes here. Honey, faintly fruity, lots of maple, oak and tobacco.

**Overall:** I really enjoyed this. Rich, complex, hits a lot of notes I enjoy and the proof and finish are significant improvement over other releases. 

Thanks for reading!
