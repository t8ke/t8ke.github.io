[**Review #254 | Bourbon Review #140 - Jack Daniels Single Barrel Barrel Proof**]( https://t8ke.review/review-254-jack-daniels-single-barrel-barrel-proof/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Brown-Forman

**Bottler:** Brown-Forman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 65.05% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, huge bananas foster, creamy, cocoa, caramel and doughy.

**Taste:** Thick oily mouthfeel and really mild for 65%. I expected a loooot of burn here and its behaving quite nicely. Mild fudge, lots of bananas, Oaky char, mild bitterness and then lots of sweetness just like the nose implied. Layers of vanilla and clove.

**Finish:** The finish is kind of where things roughen up a little. Its fine but a bit shorter than Id like and grows a touch hot. I suppose this is from the bruiser proof but overall its not what I was expecting after the palate. Little unbalanced and the astringency grows.

**Overall:** This is a sleeper gem from Jack Daniels and Im glad they released it. Its a bit of a shame that its hovering arounf the $60 mark here since I can get Bookers for $48 but did we really expect budget pricing from BF? No. Overall this is solid. The nose and palate are great but the finish cripples. it. Its still above average though and while Im not rushing out to buy any, it was a really enlightening sample that really opened my eyes to Jack Daniels potential...if only they would go after it more fervently. But then again, they are raking in money either way, so who knows if theyll be motivated to take the initiative. Im giving this a Rank 6. It could have likely competed with Bookers if the finish was more solid and I know Ill be happily taking Bookers and some significant price savings over this bottle any day.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
