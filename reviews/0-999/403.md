**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Old Pulteney

**Bottler:** Old Pulteney

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  44% ABV

**Age:** 30 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Dough, citrus, faint pepper. Lemon bars, mild salinity, vanilla. This is delicate and deliciously nuanced so far. Theres so much sweet, lightly fruity, lightly peppery going on in the nose.  

**Taste:** Vanilla cream, pleasant salinity, some oak. Theres some light pepper, delicious lemon desserts. This is really complex and delicious. Its sweet, then a little savory, then some of the light citrusy fruit notes come in only to give way back to sweet desserts and light pepper. Its a great balance.

**Finish:** Medium and sweet. Faint salinity here but not much pepper to balance. 

**Overall:** I really  dig this. The nose and palate are just incredible. This is a shining example of balance in a dram between sweet, fruity, salty, peppery. It all plays very nicely. The only real letdown for me was in the finish a hair. If there was more going on there, this would be an easy 8. Unfortunately, given the lack of a really nice finish, this will get an 8 rather than being propelled higher. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
