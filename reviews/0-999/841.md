[**Review #841 | Bourbon Review #451 - Winchester Extra Smooth Bourbon**]( https://t8ke.review/review-841-winchester-extra-smooth-bourbon/)

**The Schtick:** This is a Total Wine house brand that is sourced from TerrePURE in the Carolinas - a company that "hyper ages" distills products by attempting to age them faster than conventionally possible using a proprietary method. They claim that this process will revolutionize the industry by providing producers with products that are comparable to well aged bourbons and ryes, in just a fraction of that time. Lets see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** TerrePURE

**Bottler:** TerrePURE for Total Wine

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** .5 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Musty, sweet, sickeningly fake, peaches, sugar, dirt. Its befuddling to me that there can be such a diversity of truly terrible notes here. 

**Taste:** Thin, hot, musty, sweet, no body, cardboard and molding grain. I appreciate that they are taking the step of bottling at 45% ABV, but even then it is still thin and punishing.

**Finish:** Short, very hot, rough, musty and artificial. Super sweet. 

**Overall:** This is also horrific. If I have learned anything, it is that TerraPURE products should be avoided at practically any cost that your body can muster. I wouldnt be above selling off some quantity of flesh, in the right situation, in order to avoid having to drink any more of this than I already have.  

Thanks for reading!
