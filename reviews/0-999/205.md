[**Review #205 | Bourbon Review #115 - Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve 2016 NASA Store Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-205-kc-sib-2016-nasa-pick/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** NASA

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Spicy. Ethanol. Cinnamon, peanut brittle, theres some of that nice peanut butter. Cloves and leather notes. This one seems a little more spicy/savory than the previous which was caramel / peanut brittle heavy. So far.  

**Taste:** Spicy but some nice sweetness returning to the mix. Its definitely still hot like the others though. Lots of caramel, and a whopping scoop of Beam Funk, which I affectionately refer to Beams signature note in their bourbons that comes across to me like a batch of peanut brittle and a little scoop of vanilla ice cream. Theres also a good deal of toffee and some more caramel. Definitely transitioning to sweet from the really spicy nose.  

**Finish:**  Its long and hot but also sweet. Ive always thought that Knob Creek comes across a little hotter than it should based on the proofings. This is no different but its still good. Lots of funky peanut brittle sweetness to mingle with the heat before it meanders on.   

**Overall:** Knob has done it again. This wont blow your socks off (or at least it didnt blow mine away) but its a great, affordable, overproof bourbon. I enjoyed it despite the extra heat I felt didnt belong. 

Thanks for reading!
