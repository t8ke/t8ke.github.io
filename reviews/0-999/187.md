[**Review #187 | Bourbon Review #104 - Evan Williams 7yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-187-evan-williams-7-dusty/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Doughy and sweet. Faint corn and vanilla. Good caramel and light clove.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Not hot at all. Sweet but one dimensional pushing in the caramel / dough direction. Mild fruitiness, some dry clove and allspice. Little musty note.      

**Finish:** Medium - not hot at all but enjoyable. Sweet but more balanced all around than the palate. I like it but wouldnt pay over the current EW Black prices for it if it were still available in mass quantity.    

**Overall:** All in all - there isnt a ton to be said here. I wont put frills on it - this dusty camper is solid and delicious but nothing to go bonkers over. Its always incredibly fascinating to get a glimpse into how things used to be done and see how quality has changed since. I definitely put this over the current black label, which I have not formally reviewed, but I enjoyed this one. Its solid and doesnt demonstrate and major or apparent flaws so this fella gets to sit in the middle at Rank 5. Here, the Evan Williams 7yr Black Label sits between Buffalo Trace, Old Forester Signature, and Elijah Craig 12. Thanks for reading!

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
