**The Schtick:** This is a traditional pot still rum that is distilled at Worthy Park in Jamaica and then imported to the states and partially aged in Moscatel barrels. It is aged for 6 years in Jamaica before spending some unreleased quantity of time aging in Moscatel casks, first fill, in the States.

**Distiller:** Worthy Park

**Bottler:** Two James

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years

**Nose:**   Sweet banana, caramel, butterscotch, funky but not meaty.

**Taste:** Thick, rich. Sweet sugar, ripe banana and guava, rich funkiness, maple. The moscatel is doing super interesting things here. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and rich. Nice and funky without being overbearing.

**Overall:** This is really good, definitely unique. I really enjoyed it, and I plan to pick up a bottle soon. 

Thanks for reading!
