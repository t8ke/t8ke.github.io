[**Review #141 | Bourbon Review #78 - Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (Batch 7)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-141-elijah-craig-barrel-proof-batch-7-re-review/)

**The Schtick:** This is a moderately elusive release from Elijah Craig, which is Heaven Hill distillate bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  64% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  I dont mean to seem redundant but this is the best possible outcome. Nose on this batch is like the first batches - very similar to #5. Delicious, heavy handed on the molasses, vanilla and brown sugar notes with a hint of cherry. 

**Taste:** Still a tiny bit hot, but very much a relief from the hazmat. Delicious and complex. Cherries up front with cola and vanilla riding hard in the back. Molasses, some more dark chocolate like cocoa. 

**Finish:** Long but very mild - even in waves where I tried this one first it still seemed very mild and palatable neat, so its not just shining by comparison to the hotter batches. This one has a lot more oak and a bit less cherry and vanilla. Starts to feel a bit more like the usual dark chocolate oaky EC profile. Im not sure if I love it as much though since I did enjoy that cherry and cola on the finish. 

**Overall:** Its good. Its great. What more can I say? A little below the others but still an exceptional bourbon. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
