**The Schtick:** This was a bottle that I tried blind and I reviewed live on the Whiskey Network Discord server, then got the reveal in order to fill in relevant details here. 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Maison Ferrand

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Warm buttery frosting. Sweet cream. Toffee. Light rotting fruits, earthy sweetness. The fruits are more like papaya and some meatier melon. Overall, leans heavily in the brown sugar direction, with light fruitiness as well. No rubber or astringency here.  

**Taste:** Sweet, fruit forward. Pineapple, papaya, melon, mango. Really nice. Sweet, a little unnaturally so. Not super dosed, but potentially a bit in there. Maple, brown sugar. Light tobacco, faint pepper. Leans more sweet again, with lots of molasses and light fruit funk.

**Finish:** Short to medium, rich molasses here with even more fruit than before. No heat. Really pretty nice. The fruits like cherry, strawberry and raspberry are more vibrant, which blends well with the brown sugar. Pretty sweet here, but not cloying or super dosed. 

**Overall:** 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
