[**Review #182 | Bourbon Review #100 - Orphan Barrel Gifted Horse**]( https://t8ke.review/review-182-orphan-barrel-gifted-horse-re-review/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Diageo

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 57.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Less oak but more caramel. More ethanol and younger grain notes but overall not offensive. Maltier and sweeter, little more molasses, caramel and butterscotch driven.  

**Taste:** Thin and woody caramel. Mouthfeel and taste alone, I would peg this as a 45% ABV dram and not a 57.5. Dangerously easy drinking. Mild astringency, clove and a good deal more caramel and butterscotch.     

**Finish:** Medium but shorter than Rhetoric. Mildly astringent and way sweeter but not bad at all.    

**Overall:** Ive heard a lot about Gifted Horse but not a lot involving Gifted Horse. Aka, Ive heard about it but nothing involving how good it is or whats in the bottle. Its good but to me, other than the mellow mouthfeel and high ABV, there is nothing super notable about this dram. As a result, I give this dram a rating of 5.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
