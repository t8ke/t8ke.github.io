[**Review #463 | Bourbon Review #263 - Russells Reserve Single Barrel Bourbon TPS Selection**]( https://t8ke.review)

**The Schtick:** This is the final phase of Gobble Til You Wobble and Ill be looking at both the Bourbon and Ryes that are sold under that line. Bourbons first, ryes second. This is a modern offering from Wild Turkey with the higher entry proof. It is diluted to 110 pf and sold as a single barrel offering across the nation. Many stores have been able to do picks of these products, and extra information is available as a result. It is, still, a NAS product, though. 

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** The Party Source

**ABV:**  55% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet vanilla, caramel, creamy toffee, creme brulee, mild allspice.  

**Taste:** Thick and rich, some heat though. Sweet and oaky caramel. Theres a lot of bitterness also and a lot of pepper. Its initially really sweet but dries up almost right away.  

**Finish:** Short, hot, astringent and oaky. Tannic and dry. 

**Overall:** The nose on this was really great. The palate wasnt bad either, a hair oaky for my tastes. The finish was less than incredible. Unfortunately this dram peaked in the nose and continued slowly downhill from there. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
