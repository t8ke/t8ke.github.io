[**Review #449 | Bourbon Review #449 - Russells Reserve Single Barrel Bourbon Longman and Eagle Selection**]( https://t8ke.review)

**The Schtick:** This is the final phase of Gobble Til You Wobble and Ill be looking at both the Bourbon and Ryes that are sold under that line. Bourbons first, ryes second. This is a modern offering from Wild Turkey with the higher entry proof. It is diluted to 110 pf and sold as a single barrel offering across the nation. Many stores have been able to do picks of these products, and extra information is available as a result. It is, still, a NAS product, though.

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** Longman and Eagle

**ABV:**  55% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Fruity melon, brown sugar and butter cream. Theres some maple, some cinnamon and almost a hint of anise. Really interesting. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich mouthfeel. Theres a lot of buttery brown sugar, confectioners sugar, maple and caramel. Theres some great cocoa body here but without bitter tannins - almost a hint of oak, but no bitter. This one is really rich and sweet but balances just right. 

**Finish:** Long, no heat, delicious. Theres a little floral finish, very 4R reminiscent again. Its sweet, faintly oaky, buttery and fruity/floral. This reminds me of an OBSQ, which is all good.   

**Overall:** This is really phenomenal. I like the body, the richness, the fruity floral notes and the big robust sweetness of the brown sugar laced with some oaky body. Like I said above, this reminds me of a lower proof OBSQ and I think this is probably my favorite so far. This is revealed to be from Longman and Eagle, which is a very well respected establishment Ive not yet had the pleasure of visiting yet. Someday, L&amp;E, someday. 

Thanks for reading!
