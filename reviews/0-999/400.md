**The Schtick:** "After spending 9 years in American oak, the spirit was further matured in French oak barrels that previously held Napa Valley Bordeaux varietal red wine which added perfumed aromatics and rounded out the mouthfeel. The spirit was then tamed with pristine water originating from a hillside spring found on a property 2000 feet above the Alexander Valley in California." - From their website.

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** The Splinter Group

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  44% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Astringent. Clove, cinnamon, ethanol. Earthy...in a bad way.

**Taste:** Hot for the proof, astringent and bitter. Its funky and off - almost lactic and weirdly tart. Theres a little sweetness but its assaulted by the bitterness and astringency almost at once. 

**Finish:** Short. Hot. Bitter.

**Overall:** It is beyond me that a bourbon could be ruined like this. Whats more, its an 9yr product that is finished. Unfortunately, its awful. They must have taken the worst barrels and aged them further in even worse barrels. I poured it out. It was not good. /u/texacer please take the bottle back.

Thanks for reading!
