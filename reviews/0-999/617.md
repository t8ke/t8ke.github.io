**The Schtick:** This is a sort of fun little bottling. It is a 14yr, ex-bourbon Glen Moray bottled for Trader Joes - a hip, grocery store chain here in the States that specializes in high end, often organic and natural produce and groceries. They also sell another product, Islay Storm, that is very popular as well.

-----

**Distiller:** Glen Moray

**Bottler:** Glen Moray

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 14 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, melon, pepper and faint vanilla. There isnt a ton here, but what is present is pleasant. 

**Taste:** Thin, but no heat. Lots of honey, melon, some faint oakiness. Little bit of vanilla and butter cream. All in all, pretty light, but not offensive, given the proof.

**Finish:** Short, no heat and loaded with green apples. 

**Overall:** If you told me this was Glenlivet Lite, Id believe you. All in all, this is a gentle, mild, not bold, completely not bad product. Is it worth $30? Thats up to you. I dont mind gambling $30 or less on something Ive never had - especially an age stated single malt. This would be a good warm up dram, but I think it earns the score it gets. 

Thanks for reading!
