**The Schtick:** This is the 2015 release of the Oban Distillers Edition. 

-----

**Distiller:** Oban

**Bottler:** Oban

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Hay, honey and grain. Light cream and a tiny bit of floral fragrance. 

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel but sweet honey followed by a mild spice. Very little alcohol on the tongue and not a whole lot going on besides sweet grains and mild honey. Its delicious, if a little one dimensional. 

**Finish:** Medium and gentle. Sweet. 

**Overall:** I like this but its not wildly complex. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
