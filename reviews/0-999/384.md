**The Schtick:**

**Distiller:** Clement

**Bottler:** Clement

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:** 62.5% ABV

**Age:** 24 Years

**Nose:**  Really citrus forward. Theres some earthy nuttiness to it. Not quite like a bbq meat funk but some earthy, moldy, under ripe cantaloupe notes here. Sweetness, ginger, vanilla.

**Taste:** Hot hot hot. I get that its clocking in at 62.5% but it feels a touch hot, even for that. A few extra minutes rest (my standard is 15 minutes, so I did 20 min here) seems to help mellow the fire. Sweet and savory are both here but this dram leans very much in the sweet direction. Sweet confectioners sugar, bananas, lemons and some orange peel are big notes here with lots of cinnamon, clove and strong notes of nutmeg.

**Finish:** Long. Theres lots of heat here, but the length is good. Heat really seems to settle down here compared to the palate.

**Overall:** This is a hot rum, and I found through the course of the bottle to enjoy it more over a cube than just neat. Since I love rum forward cocktails, I also gave it its fair share of time to shine there also. It played alright, but often times was difficult to balance - both in regards to the heat and to the very strong confectioners sugar and orange peel notes. It was just made to dominate. Overall, I enjoyed this bottle, but I dont feel any real pressure to get another one.

Thanks for reading!
