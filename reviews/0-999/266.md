[**Review #266 | Bourbon Review #146 - Very Special Old Fitzgerald 12yr 2016**]( https://t8ke.review/review-266-very-special-old-fitzgerald-2016/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Brown sugar, molasses, cinnamon, clove, caramel, and oak.

**Taste:** Thin, sweet, oaky, baking sweets and dough, caramel and vanilla. There is a sweet fruity element but not overbearing like Weller 12. This might be the wheaten I dont actively dislike since I find so many cloying.

**Finish:** Medium, mildly astringent, its definitely wheated based on the sweet fruity aftertaste.

**Overall:** I enjoy this but it borders on too sweet. Luckily, it doesnt plunge over the edge and I respect it for that. There is some astringency and burn for a dram thats only 90 proof but its not too overbearing. Overall, I enjoyed this and I enjoyed it far more than expected. Im going to give this a Rank 5. It would easily make it to a Rank 6 if the finish was a little more well rounded.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
