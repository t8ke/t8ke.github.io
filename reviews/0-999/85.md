[**Review #85 | Bourbon Review #47 - Blade and Bow**]( https://t8ke.review/review-85-blade-and-bow/)

**The Schtick:** This is a product from Diageo that has some tiny component of Stitzel Weller. They make sure to tell you that, over and over, since its printed on the bottle just shy of 20 times. Since the price tag is "only" $49.99, there cant be much SW distillate inside. That leaves the rest to be distillate of unknown provenance. That being said, lets see how the liquid inside is. 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Diageo

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 45.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Butter cream, vanilla and a healthy dose of artificial banana. I dont mind this for some reason. Its super sweet but kind of inviting.    

**Taste:** Light mouthfeel, banana and vanilla, cinnamon and butter cream. Its oddly hot though, for a 91 pf whiskey. Not too hot though, but I notice it a bit more than I thought I would. 

**Finish:** Medium and well balanced, theres a lot more allspice, clove and cinnamon and kind of moseys gently. 

**Overall:** This whiskey relies on some heavy marketing, a solera vat and the name of the ol Stitzel Weller. This one isnt amazing, but I can see its merits. It has a time and a place.

Thanks for reading!
