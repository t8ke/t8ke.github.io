[**Review #97 | Bourbon Review #54 - Buffalo Trace Mashbill 1 White Dog**]( https://t8ke.review/review-97-buffalo-trace-mashbill-1-white-dog/)

**The Schtick:** This is Buffalo Traces Mashbill #1 Distillate bottled before aging. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace 

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 62.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Corn and oh so sweet cream. Malty sweetness. 

**Taste:** Its hot and rough but very sweet and filled with grain and malt sweetness. Its a lot like oversweet cornbread and I oddly enjoy it. 

**Finish:** Short and hot. Theres a lot of corn here. Almost sickeningly sweet. 

**Overall:** So this is what some brands of BT bourbon start out as. I think its really something and pretty enjoyable before the aging process. Its also very fascinating to see how a lot of the BT lines Ive tried and reviewed lately respond to the aging process. Its oddly enjoyable, very sweet and a great look at what bourbon starts out as. Id recommend a sip for any person who hasnt tried some yet, just to see how things change over time.  

Thanks for reading!
