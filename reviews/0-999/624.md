[**Review #624 | Bourbon Review #364 - Old Weller Antique Loch and Key Selection #57**]( https://t8ke.review/review-624-old-weller-antique-loch-and-key-selection/)

**The Schtick:** This is a well proofed wheater released from Buffalo Trace. It is a NAS product using the wheated mashbill. Old Weller Antique used to be a common, easily available and affordable product, but has recently been struck by the halo effect generated by Buffalo Traces other, higher tier products. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** Loch and Key

**ABV:** 53.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet caramel, honey and loads of Werthers caramels. Light vanilla icing. Some ethanol, but not overbearing. Faint waffle cone notes. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouthfeel. Immediate heat. Sweet honey and vanilla, toffee and vanilla sundae. Its really sweet and theres some nice oak and pepper rather than the usual cinnamon blast. Almost oaky. 

**Finish:** Long but the heat arrives in force here. Some sweetness and some astringent peppery notes. 

**Overall:** This has a nice set of notes on the palate but was a bit thin, and the finish was quite toasty (hot). 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
