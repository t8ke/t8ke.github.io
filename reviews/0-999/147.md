[**Review #147 | Rye Review #82 - WhistlePig Single Barrel Cask Strength Rye Cork Dorks Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-147-whistlepig-sib-cs-rye-cork-dorks/)

**The Schtick:** This is a society pick by Cork Dorks in TN from WhistlePig. 

-----

**Distiller:** Alberta

**Bottler:** Whistle Pig

**Selection:** Cork Dorks

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Huge brown sugar, maple and cloves. Spicy combined with sweet - there is a huge rye spice to accompany the sweet sugars although metallic and dill notes are non-existant. 

**Taste:** Thick and sweet - some metallic and minty note does filter in here though. I dont mind though, I think it plays well. Its surprisingly gentle, Id have no idea this was 120pf if I was sampling blind, which makes this dangerously delicious. Its almost like a nice syrup with a good rye kick and great mouth feel.

**Finish:** Long and complex. Yet again, not hot at all, and filled with a delicious balance of maple sugar and dry rye spice.  

**Overall:** Im blown away. How Ive let WP CS rye slip by my radar, Ill never know. Its delicious, full bodied and well made. It also appears to be well priced and I would consider adding one to my collection if I was in a buying place right now. This dram is certainly a favorite. T

Thanks for reading!
