[**Review #22 | Scotch Review #1 - Glenmorangie LaSanta**]( https://t8ke.review/review-22-glenmorangie-lasanta/)

**The Schtick:** This is a core range offering from Glenmorangie. It is produced in the "tallest stills in Scotland" and aged for 10 years in ex-bourbon casks. From there, it spends an additional 2 years maturing in a sherry cask. Bottled at 43% and sold for about $45 in Wisconsin, its finally lured me in.

**Distiller:** Glenmorangie

**Bottler:** Glenmorangie

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years

**Nose:**  Honey, wine, sherry, vanilla and some cinnamon. A nice balance of sweet, fruity and a hint of spice.    

**Taste:** Its light and delicate but has a reasonably nice mouth feel. Theres a bit of spice in the end, maybe some cinnamon and nutmeg? Theres lots of Glenmorangie base spirit influence in here but the sherry adds a nice touch. Vanilla, some grainy notes, sweet sherry and a hint of caramel.     

**Finish:** The finish is shorter than expected, but not disappointing. Its still well blended, with a nice exit of more fruit and sherry.   

**Overall:** This is a reasonable good dram, and I enjoyed it. Glenmorangie base spirit always seems to manifest a faint bitterness to me, but this did well in covering that up.    

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
