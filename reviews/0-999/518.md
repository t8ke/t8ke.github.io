**Nose:**   Faint overripe fruits, toffee, caramel, faint meatiness

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, sweet fruits, oak, clove and lots of maple

**Finish:** Medium length, some heat. Nice combo of funk and oak

**Overall:** I like this, good balance of oak, funk and sweetness. I was pretty surprised at how much I liked this, given the provenance. Id love to continue to try some more products as they release them so Ill keep them on my radar. 

Thanks for reading!
