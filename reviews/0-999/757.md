[**Review #757 | Scotch Review #254 - Highland Park Loki (Valhalla Collection)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-757-highland-park-loki-valhalla-collection/)

**The Schtick:** The second release in Highland Parks Valhalla Collection following last years Thor release. Loki is Thors adoptive brother, a mischievous soul, possibly even a shape-shifter and certainly an enigmatic character.

-----

**Distiller:** Highland Park

**Bottler:** Highland Park 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 48.7% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Buttered biscuits, sweet wine. Caramel, offee, salt, faint smoke. Almost a salted caramel feel to it. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, sweet caramel. Peat smoke, pepper, faint salinity. Almost mildly jammy with some citrus. The peat is mostly ashy smoke, not too vegetal or bandage-y. 

**Finish:** Long, peppery, smoky. Nice and sweet. This blends pretty well overall. 

**Overall:** Interesting, diverse and enjoyable. Mostly sweet, some smoke, some salinity. I think more smoke would have helped this out but it was enjoyable nonetheless. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
