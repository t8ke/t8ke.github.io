**The Schtick:**  Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit is a single barrel Wild Turkey product aged somewhere from 8.5ish to 9.5ish years. Its bottled at 101 proof with a mashbill consisting of 75% corn, 13% rye and 12% malt.

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** Total Beverage

**ABV:** 50.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Rich caramel, some oak here, mild ethanol. Vanilla, cream, Turkey spice in force. Clove, some cinnamon and some more oak.

**Taste:** Still some heat, drinks a hair hot for 101 but its sweet and savory - some faint nuttiness, cream, toffee, caramel. Oak barges in with some spice and nice tobacco / earthiness. Really nice balance here.

**Finish:** Finish is oddly shorter than before but its still decent. Heat is in check here. Nice and sweet - great balance of oak and sweeter notes like vanilla, cream, toffee, etc. It grows really dry and tannic though on its way out.

**Overall:** Theres a lot more balance in this pick. I really enjoyed how much sweet there was here and that helped really offset the majority of the really dry / tannic, bitter notes from what I suspect is odd single barrel oak integration. If this finish had shaped up just a hair, this would be flirting with 7 territory. Unfortunately, though, this is a solid 6 - which is not shameful in any respect.

Thanks for reading!
