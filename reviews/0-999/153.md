[**Review #153 | Scotch Review #58 - Glenfiddich 14yr Bourbon Barrel Reserve**]( https://t8ke.review/review-153-glenfiddich-14yr-bourbon-barrel-reserve/)

**The Schtick:** This is an ex-bourbon matured Glenfiddich.

-----

**Distiller:** Glenfiddich

**Bottler:** Glenfiddich

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 14 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Creamy apples and pears, theres a good deal of vanilla and molasses also. Minor cinnamon spice, but nothing too heavy. 

**Taste:** Mild and fruity, sweet with vanilla and cream and a mild char. Its not deep or complex but its light and unassuming. I dont mind it, it seems like a great dram for a picnic or for sitting on the porch reading. Despite its lack of depth, it is well blended with everything melding together nicely. 

**Finish:**  Medium and gentle. Not a whole lot here besides some nice light molasses and apples/pears. 

**Overall:** Its not bad. If it were a couple dollars cheaper, Id be all over it at the store. For an age stated, 14yr product in US market only, its really not bad at all but at $50, Im turning my eyes towards other bottles. All in all though, despite being light and simple, its a nice summer dram. 

Thanks for reading!
