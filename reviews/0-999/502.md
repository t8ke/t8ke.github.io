**Nose:**  Craft funk, wet cardboard, really musty. Theres some maple, some sweet vanilla and some mossy notes. Overall, its pretty rank. 

**Taste:** Thin and sickly sweet. Its musty, funky, young and loaded with new make notes. Astringent and loaded with those young wet cardboard craft notes. 

**Finish:** Short with some heat. The finish is pretty gross, still loaded with musty new make notes. 

**Overall:** I have to be transparent here - this bottle was a gift from a friend. It was a great act of generosity and Im happy I got to try it and review it. But good lord, this is garbage in every sense of the word. I regret consuming as much of this bottle as I did in the hopes I would find some redeeming quality. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 2**
