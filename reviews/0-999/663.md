**The Schtick:** This is a private pick of an 11yr cask from MGP, bottled by Smooth Ambler in West Virginia. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Smooth Ambler

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  61% ABV

**Age:** 11 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Clove, brown sugar, confectioners sugar. Some nice pepper, more sweet than spicy. Very standard MGP profile here.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, sweet with lots of honey and caramel. Theres a good deal of vanilla, pepper and allspice. Theres a bit of heat and some nice melon undertones. 

**Finish:** Medium length with a bit of heat, but not punishing. Sweet honey, fruity melon and faint cherry notes with a good allspice backbone. 

**Overall:** This was a nice selection and it highlights a lot of the notes that make the MGP bourbon profile a very solid release. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
