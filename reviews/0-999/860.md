-----

**Distiller:** Kilchoman

**Bottler:** Kilchoman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 56.8% ABV

**Age:** 5 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich vanilla, cream, peat. The peat is straying to the iodine, bandage, rich fungal peat. Fresh baked bread, light stewed fruits. Sweet toffee. 

**Taste:** Thick, rich, very nice mouth feel. Heat is in check. Lots of sweet honey, light melon, rich toffee. Some pepper, some oak. Lots of nice syrupy fruits. Like a vibrant DOLE fruit syrup. The peat is there too, more ashy and woody than the nose would have led me to suspect. Only mild bandages. No fishiness, no iodine. Some burning rubber. 

**Finish:** Long, rich, growing more ashy. Pepper, ash, burning wood blends really nicely with the vanilla and toffee forward profile. The sherry is there too, but subtly so. Not a sherry bomb by any means. Really nice, complex showing from Kilchoman in this finish.

**Overall:** Overall, Im very impressed. This is an exercise in complexity and nuance, rather than going off into any one direction. Not a bread bomb, not a sherry bomb, not a peat bomb. Just right in every direction. Really enjoyable.

Thanks for reading!
