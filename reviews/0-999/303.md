[**Review #303 | Bourbon Review #303 - Charbay: Bourbon Crusaders Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-303-charbay-bourbon-crusaders-pick/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Charbay

**Bottler:** Charbay

**Selection:** Bourbon Crusaders

**ABV:** 73.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Huge hoppy, oily, almost vegetal nose with lots of grain and hop characteristics. Sweet, toffee, some ethanol (dont blame it for 147pf)

**Taste:** Wow. Just fuckin wow. Massive, oily mouthfeel. Huge flavor. The burn is real but its definitely forgiving despite the proof. Huge hoppy, stouty notes concentrated with tons of coffee, toffee, caramel, oak. Sweet, vegetal, like nothing Ive every tried before.

**Finish:** Long, brutally hot but thats to be expected. Sweet, malty. Hoppy, stouty. Massive flavor even here, sweet toffee and an extra something I just cant explain.

**Overall:** This was phenomenal. Its weird as hell but I dig it. Im giving this a 9. I want a bottle and I"m going to do everything I can to get more of this even though its a long shot. Im left just wowing to myself.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 9**
