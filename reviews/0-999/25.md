**The Schtick:** The core expression from Ardbeg. 

-----

**Distiller:** Ardbeg

**Bottler:** Ardbeg

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years

**Nose:**  Yep, there it is. Big smoke. Less refined than the Corry but still very smokey and peaty. Its less overwhelming but also more smokey than peaty. Im getting a good amount of char, maybe even a little mud. It reminds me of a good ATV ride in the backwoods - this would be an excellent camping dram. After, theres a tiny bit of vanilla and sweetness.

**Taste:** Theres a ton of smoke here. Burnt marshmallow. Theres a little peat as well. Im picking up some muted astringent plastic notes? Theres some more smoke, actually theres just a lot of smoke. I wish I could pull more out of this but this one is proving difficult for me.    

**Finish:** The finish is really quite long. Its warm, and theres more alcohol burn/tingle as opposed to the Corry but its not overpowered or punishing in the least. This is where I notice the smoke most - I felt like I had been standing next to a bonfire for quite sometime after I finished this dram. Theres a little more plastic but not enough to be distasteful.  

**Overall:** Gentle, complex, nice and peaty. This smoky dram is a great value and brings a lot to the table. 

Thanks for reading!
