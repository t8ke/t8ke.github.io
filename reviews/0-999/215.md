[**Review #215 | Scotch Review #215 - Glen Scotia 15 Year**]( https://t8ke.review/review-215-glen-scotia-15yr/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Glen Scotia

**Bottler:** Glen Scotia

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Doughy yeasty baking sweets, vanilla, toffee and cloves and cinnamon. Kind of an oatmeal note. Mild smoke char, salted caramel is really heavy. Smells very inviting

**Taste:** Mild smoke and char. Burnt brown sugar. More doughy malty sweetness and a whole lot of toffee. More salted caramel follows. Im really enjoying this and the mouth feel is good even for the proof.

**Finish:** Medium but gentle. Well blended and sweet with good char notes mixed in.

**Overall:** I really enjoyed this dram and I chugged (not literally) through my third of the bottle dangerously fast. I think it maybe lasted two weeks. It is well rounded and hits a lot of notes I like. The oatmeal and salted caramel notes were also a neat new niche. Its a little pricey at $99 a bottle but certainly not unreasonable. It didnt blow me away but I thoroughly enjoyed this. For this reason, Im rating Glen Scotia 15 a 6 - definitely a cut above.

Thanks for reading!
