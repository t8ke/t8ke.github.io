**The Schtick:** This is a 12yr bottling of GlenDronach 12. It was bottled in 2013, though, which means the contents are likely much older due to the several year period that GlenDronach spent closed. 

-----

**Distiller:** GlenDronach

**Bottler:** GlenDronach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years

**Nose:**  Theres honey, theres vanilla, theres some light fruit like apple and pear and then BAM the sherry hits. Its not quite Macallan on the dark fruit/raisen scale but the sherry is there in force and its delicious. Its complex and well blended for its age and Im a fan. 

**Taste:** Spice, light pepper and some honey followed by more sherry notes. The fruit and sweetness are there and give way to vanilla and a tiny bit of cinnamon. 

**Finish:** The finish isnt insanely long but its well blended and nice and warming all of the way down. Theres (surprise) more sherry and it peters off with one last blast of fruity sweetness.

**Overall:** I expected to enjoy this dram but I loved it more than I expected. Its well blended, has lots of complexity and really hits a lot of notes I enjoy. 

Thanks for reading!
