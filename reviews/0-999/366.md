[**Review #366 | Bourbon Review #366 - Wild Turkey Forgiven**]( https://t8ke.review/review-366-wild-turkey-forgiven/)

**The Schtick:** Wild Turkey Forgiven is supposedly the result of an "accident" on premises that resulted in a bourbon and rye blend a la Bourye (from High West).

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 45.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet fruity cream. Corn, bazooka bubblegum (wtf), mild clove. Heavy cream. This is the mother of all strange. Not spicy or earthy like Bourye from High West

**Taste:** Thin mouthfeel, much better though. Tastes like a bourbon - vanilla, clove, mild oak with a tinge of spice on the back of the palate. Thin, almost universally sweet though and borderline cloying.

**Finish:** Short. Astringent then a wallop of sweet cream. Some turkey spice but then its all gone.

**Overall:** Uhm, whoever forgave this was not in their right mind. Its funky, overly sweet and thin with very little rye characteristic showing through. In addition, the bourbon that trumps the rye isnt even that great. Rank 4.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
