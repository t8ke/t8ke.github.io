**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** High West 

**Selection:** Ace 

**ABV:** 49.9% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, clove, some candied fruit. Heavy cinnamon. Surprisngly, overall its fairly muted. Maybe I expected more orange? I dont know what I expected but there isnt a ton here in terms of intensity.

**Taste:** Initially bitter, sweet vanilla flushes in. Theres some muted candied fruits, almost like a citrusy sherry. Its weird - Ill admit that for sure. Some molasses but very little before turning bitter again.

**Finish:** Mildly astringent growing more herbal. Fruity and bitter with some faint vanilla.

**Overall:** Its okay but Ive said it before and Ill say it again - garbage in means garbage out. Now, Im not calling American Prairie garbage but its not great whiskey and the finish doesnt really seem to have improved it. Its just made it...different. I didnt mind sipping this neat but this really seems to sit in cocktail territory for me. It doesnt do any one thing very well and the all over the place flavor, astringency and herbal bitterness leave me less than thrilled to drink a whole bottle of it. Then comes the price. $60ish? No thank you. I see this as something to liven up a cocktail but I couldnt justify the price for the purpose. For this reason, Im giving this dram a 4 - theres some flaws to overcome but it isnt wretched. Im still curious on the others though. Im going to do what I can to get my paws on some other finishes for Rendezvous Rye, Double Rye and now American Prairie. Gotta try em all!

Thanks for reading!
