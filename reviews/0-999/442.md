**The Schtick:** This is the final phase of Gobble Til You Wobble and Ill be looking at both the Bourbon and Ryes that are sold under that line. Bourbons first, ryes second. This is a modern offering from Wil Turkey with the higher entry proof. It is diluted to 110 pf and sold as a single barrel offering across the nation. Many stores have been able to do picks of these products, and extra information is available as a result. It is, still, a NAS product, though.

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  55% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Caramel, toffee, vanilla, buttery sweetness. Mild clove and a good bit of pepper. All sweet, little fruitiness, spice balances wonderfully. Not too much, not too little. 

**Taste:** Really thick and rich. Some passion fruit notes (like I get in ER10, hm) and that quickly turns to vanilla, caramel, toffee, clove and spice. Its sweet, well balanced and really complex.  

**Finish:**  Medium length but very dessert forward on the way out - loads of toffee, cocoa and some cracked pepper.

**Overall:** Goodness, this is good. Its well balanced, loaded with lots of pleasant flavors and complex. The sweet, the fruity, the spicy and savory all blend very nicely here. This is revealed to be the JBs pick - a store Ive never heard of courtesy of /u/tvraisedme - but delicious all the same. I really enjoyed this one. 

Thanks for reading!
