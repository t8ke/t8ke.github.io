[**Review #167 | Rye Review #92 - Willett Family Estate 6yr Single Barrel Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-167-willet-family-estate-6yr-rye-barrel-128-re-review/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Willett

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 58.7% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Molasses, brown sugar. Theres some clove and allspice with a nice hit of pine and oak. Minty as well in a spearmint fashion.  

**Taste:** Theres dill, mint and sugar. This is how I described the sample from another barrel and theres little variation here. I notice a good deal more sweetness though, like thicken brown sugar and more molasses. Almost a shoo-fly pie kinda note. Delicious.

**Finish:** Sharp rye spice. Long and a bit hotter but also more complex. The dill is toned down a hair but it still feels a tad rough. At this proof though its delicious. 

**Overall:** There is some noticeable variation here in contrast to the bottle I have but its good and bad. I dont like this sample any less. In fact, I might like it a hair more. This is definitely still a step above, but to me its not quite SAOS 7yr Rye. I love the proof though. If I could get SAOS 7yr at this proof every day on the shelf...Id go wild. Back to this dram though, its sweet, hot and brings all those lovely rye notes around. I dig it. 

Thanks for reading!
