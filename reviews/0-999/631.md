**The Schtick:** This is a 21yr old, sherried single malt whiskey from our pals at The GlenDronach distillery. 

-----

**Distiller:** GlenDronach

**Bottler:** GlenDronach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  48% ABV

**Age:** 21 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Deep sherry, figs, stewed fruits, grapes and honey. Cocoa and tobacco are really prominents as well as some earthiness, some honey and a wisp of sulfur. 

**Taste:** Medium thickness, no heat. Sweet sherry, sticky honey pastries and vanilla. Earthy pipe tobacco. Swetewd fruits like figs, raspberries, date fruits, and then a massive load of sulfur. Its peppery, bittering and just pungent. It becomes all consuming. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet but super sulfury. 

**Overall:** This dram started in a stellar place. The nose is phenomenal. But the growing intensity of the sulfur notes from "present" to "all consuming" are not only off putting, but they cover all of the great notes in the nose and beat them into the ground by the finish. I wish I could score this higher, but unfortunately, the quality just isnt there. Originally I rated this a 6/10 when I reviewed it live in the Discord server but after spending more time with it, Im knocking it down to a 5. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
