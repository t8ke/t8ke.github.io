**The Schtick:** This is the second expression from this line that I am reviewing. While barrel deviation is higher than average in this product line, it is a well priced barrel proofer of Brown-Forman distillate. 

-----

**Distiller:** Jack Daniels

**Bottler:** Jack Daniels

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 67.05% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet bananas foster. Caramel, honey roasted peants, toffee and brown sugar. Nutty, funky, sweet banana dessert.  

**Taste:** Thick and rich with a really assertive honey roasted peanut profile. Bananas are here also, with some heat, molasses, vanilla and toffee. Theres some really nice pepper and a bit of allspice which helps round out the dessert centered profile. 

**Finish:** Long, but real hot. Sweet and oaky, but not dry. Bananas foster and honey roasted peanuts dominate the finish but balance very well with the oak.

**Overall:** This is a great barrel. Its sweet, fruity and spicy. Its hot, but the proof is bananas. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
