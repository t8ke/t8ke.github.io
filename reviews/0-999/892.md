[**Review #892 | Bourbon Review #468 - Weller Special Reserve**]( https://t8ke.review/review-892-weller-special-reserve/)

**The Schtick:** This is the lower most entry in Buffalo Traces Weller line of expressions - wheated bourbons sold under the William Larue Weller (and various permutations) name. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  innamon, clove, red hot candies. Ethanol. Faint caramel.

**Taste:** Thin, hot cinnamon. Clove, pepper, faint oak. Bitter with mild astringency.

**Finish:** Short, hot. Cinnamon, faint caramel. Really one dimensional.

**Overall:** Overall, this is clearly young, and a bit too hot. A one noted profile also cripples it in comparison to other wheated bourbons I have tried and enjoyed. I would put this on par with Larceny and Old Fitzgerald Prime, but dont find it as good as Old Fitzgerald Bottled in Bond. The heat and cinnamon forward formula would make this a nice complement to many classic cocktail recipes, given the budget pricing, as well.  

Thanks for reading!
