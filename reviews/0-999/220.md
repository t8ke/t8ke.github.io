**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven HIll

**Selection:** Big Red 

**ABV:** 43.3% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet corn, caramel and a lot of vanilla. Light on the oak for 10 years old. Its very sweet and vanilla forward.

**Taste:** Thin and very sweet. Lots of oak, caramel and vanilla. Not a lot of bitterness or astringency. Overall, its very sweet and the corn seems more prominent than I would have expected.

**Finish:** Medium and growing a bit woodier. Some oaky bitterness. Mostly just sweet vanilla cream though. Delicious and not hot.

**Overall:** Overall, Evan Williams SiB is a really great value. I can find a normal bottle of whatever the current vintage is around me for less than $20. That being said, I can tell they are chewing through stocks. This one is 10 years old. Last year the 2005 and 2006 were on the shelves and Im already seeing the 2008 hit near me with a much younger statement. Im happy theyre keeping the age statement and all of that fun stuff and its nice to have a look on how the stocks are doing. Overall, this wasnt the most complex bottle and it was very sweet but I dont necessarily mind that. Its a great everyday dram and I went through this bottle way too fast. Im giving Evan Williams Single Barrel 2004 Vintage a 5 - a very deserving title and score for this budget bourbon.

Thanks for reading!
