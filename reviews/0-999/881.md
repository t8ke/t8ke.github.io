-----

**Distiller:** Highland Park

**Bottler:** Murray McDavid

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 26 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet cream, honey, apple juice. Faint smoke, lingering brine. Bready and sweet. Lots of vanilla. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Lots of sweetness here. Smoke is also present in force. Some heat. Sweet vanilla, mild cocoa. Lots of pepper, faint oak. Some wafer cookie. Little stewed fruits, but mostly a dram focused on the peat and vanilla / oak influence. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and sweet. Vanilla, rich, ashy smoke. Lots of berries here - blackberry and cranberry with the cocoa and sweetness. Ash continues on for some time.

**Overall:** Really quite nice, and a great marriage of oak, Highland Park smoke and some new found fruitiness. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
