**The Schtick:** Stranahans is an American craft distiller in Colorado. They produce a variety of American single malt products each year, but each winter they release a special, limited edition expression in their Snowflake line. This expression, #17 or Longs Peak, is matured in a variety of barrels: a local beer cask sporting an ESB from Breckenridge Brewery, Chancellor wine cask produced at Spero Winery in Denver, and a Spanish Oloroso sherry cask. These were then blended together and bottled to produce this specific release.

**Nose:**  Sweet honey, toffee, a nice fruity tartness, faintly lactic. Baking flour, rich red currants and sulfur.   

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, no heat. Sweet, fruity and loaded with vanilla. Rich stewed fruits, malty and bold. Apples, like an apple pie, baking spices and caramel. Some malty cocoa. 

**Finish:** Medium length, loaded with sweet stewed fruits, clove, baking spice and caramel. The complexity is impressive.  

**Overall:** I didnt know what I would think of this but I really enjoyed it. The complexity was impressive and it didnt beat you over the head with one specific note. I thought this was really well done. 

Thanks for reading!
