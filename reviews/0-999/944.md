**The Schtick:** Knob Creek is a very familiar product to me, distilled at Beam in Kentucky. This is a 13 year store pick of their Single Barrel Reserve line of expressions, and is bottled at 60% ABV. 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 13 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Oak, rock candy, orange peel. Toffee, peanut brittle, dark chocolate cherry cordials. Overall, rich dessert notes with a savory undertow. 

**Taste:** Medium to thick mouth feel, impressively mild mouth feel. Cocoa, cherry cordials, honey and tobacco. Some heat makes an appearance. Lots of vanilla, a pleasant orange peel note and lots of tobacco. 

**Finish:** Long, some heat here, but lots of rich tobacco and pepper. No real astringency. This blends well with a bold cocoa note, followed by more citrus zest and toffee. 

**Overall:** Really impressive selection from KLWines. Some of these older casks can border on over oaked but this plays savory tobacco against a good balance of fruit notes and dessert-y toffee notes. Really enjoyable. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
