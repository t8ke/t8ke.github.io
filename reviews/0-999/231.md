**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Longrow

**Bottler:** Longrow

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 51.3% ABV

**Age:** 11 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet sweet thick cream, rich jammy fruit, some peat smoke but its subdeied with some pepper. Rich pound cake, fruit cake, any fruit turnover dish etc etc. This thing is sweet as the day is long with rich heavy fruit and then a raw burst of peppery peat.

**Taste:** Sweet and complex with heavy jammy fruits like apple, strawberry, raspberry, date fruit, fig, etc. Pepper, peat, smoke and a really savory char note. God this is good. Butter cream to follow. Its sweet, fruity, peppery, charred paradise.

**Finish:** Long and sweet but complex. Massive flavor and there is no inkling that this is over 100 proof from the taste and finish which makes this a delicious, dangerous beast.

**Overall:** 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
