-----

**Distiller:** Dalmore

**Bottler:** Dalmore

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years

**Nose:**  Sweet caramel, sherry and raisins. Like sweet raisin bread. Some cinnamon. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, not a lot of heat. Some oaky bitterness, clove, sweet vanilla. Very bourbon like combined with the sherry notes. Like a big loaf of raisin bread. 

**Finish:** Short but pleasantly sweet, sherry is most prominent here. 

**Overall:** This is good, but not overwhelmingly so. Its unique in that it tastes like a loaf of raisin bread but it doesnt wow me. 

Thanks for reading!
