[**Review #495 | Scotch Review #180 - Cutty Sark (1961)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-495-cutty-sark-1961/)

**The Schtick:** Comes with a built in pourer! Figured this might be an interesting / fun side by side experiment. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Cutty Sark

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Heavy graham cracker. Faint ethanol, lots of grain. Sweet confectioners sugar. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, caramel apple, faint smoke, honey and vanilla. Much less grain tasting than expected

**Finish:** Short, astringent. Heavy caramel notes, honey and apple. 

**Overall:** This is significantly better than the product released by Cutty today. Unfortunately, that means its still sub-par whiskey. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
