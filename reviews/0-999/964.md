**The Schtick:** Makers Mark, one of the larger producers of bourbon in Kentucky, produces wheated bourbon that is sold both domestically and abroad. Until recent years, Makers only produced a small handful of products. In the last couple of years, though, products like Makers Mark 46 and Makers Mark Cask Strength have seen domestic releases. A major criticism of the brand, though, was the absence of a barrel selection program in favor of wax dipped limited editions. That has now changed. A barrel selection at Makers Mark is unique, though, in that you choose a combination of staves to mature in a barrel, and that barrel is bottled. This is different from almost any other barrel selection process on the market. For better or for worse, this creates a very different product than their core line of expressions. Ive set out to try approximately a dozen of these various private selections, completely blind, to gather my thoughts on how their releases are shaking out. 

-----

**Distiller:** Makers Mark

**Bottler:** Makers Mark

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 55.1% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Caramel, parchment paper, light cocoa. Nutty toffee, cherry and confectioners sugar. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Very little heat. Honey, almonds, light amaretto. Musty tobacco, clove and a nice cherry note. 

**Finish:** Medium in length, the heat is subdued, but faintly present. Clove, pepper, tobacco and caramel dominate here with some light fruitiness. 

**Overall:** Really nice. Much more complex than I was expecting. Very nice blend of sweet and musty older bourbon notes with some younger fruitier components as well.

Thanks for reading!
