**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Willett

**Bottler:** Willett

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Molasses turned up to 11. Overload. Delicious overload. Leather and clove, maple and some dusty, mildly vegetal notes. Little bit of wet paper. Lots of sweet and good balance of clove, maple and maple. Mmmm 

**Taste:** Maple. Fruity banana, some apple. clove and leather, dusty oaky molasses.  

**Finish:** Long and deceptively complex. This is surprising me in all sorts of ways. Maple and not at all hot. 

**Overall:** Its good, and above average. Maple like no tomorrow and a complex, long gentle finish. I enjoy it a whole lot despite knowing basically nothing about it. I rate it squarely a cut above the median, garnering a respectable 6! In fact, Id probably take this over W12 any day. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
