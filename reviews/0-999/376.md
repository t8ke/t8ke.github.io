-----

**Nose:**  Like golden grahams. Sweet cinnamon, spice, caramel. no astringency here. Just pleasant sweetness

**Taste:** Nice rich mouthfeel. Sweet caramel, and lots of it. Oak is very well in check here with almost a cocoa undertone. Delicious. Caramel, some doughy sweetness.

**Finish:** Long, mildly astringent but sweet and savory.

**Overall:** This is really nice. T his is probably the most balanced modern pick Ive had so far. The sweetness is there, the oak is there, the dry tannins are there but all play very nicely. This also had a lack of that off astringency in the palate which really is what really impressed me. It showed up in the finish but not too strongly.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
