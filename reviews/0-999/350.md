**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Stitzel Weller

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.01% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Old parchment. Dusty leather. Sweet cherry dark chocolates. Deep toffee. Sitting for a bit lets it open up a bit to release tons of deep toffee, thich cola and rich caramel notes. Quite distinctive from the 1973 6yr BiB I reviewed a while back. I could sit and smell this literally all day, and all night long. If they made a Glade plugin...Id consider it.

**Taste:** Medium on the palate in terms of heat but thick and rich. Caramel. Toffee. Oily with some parchment, almost a little dusty or leathery. Lots of cherry, dark cocoa, toffee. Really chewy and delicious.

**Finish:** Long, no heat to speak of. Theres a surprising amount of oak here to play with the sweetness. Just phenomenal.

**Overall:** Wowza. 350 reviews and each has been a pleasure. This snow day couldnt be any better. This is a phenomenal dram and quite distinctive from the 73. Little more delicate, little more oak / parchment notes. Still a caramel / cherry / cocoa bruiser, though. Very delicious. Glad I opened it and was able to share with friends on a few occasions. Rank 9. But alas, the snowday continues and theres one or two stragglers yet to come.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 9**
