**The Schtick:** "Octomore 6.3 Islay Barley is the first release of the uber-experimental cult classic to be distilled using 100% Islay-grown barley. The crop was sown in 2008 by our friend James Brown in the field known as Lorgba on his Octomore Farm. This lies close to the western shore of Loch Indaal on the Rhinns of Islay, and within sight of the village of Port Charlotte.

**Distiller:** Bruichladdich

**Bottler:** Bruichladdich

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  64% ABV

**Age:** 5 Years

**Nose:**  Massive, huge, abrasive, peat. Pepper, BBQ smoked ribs. Monster salinity. Bacon, tobacco, lemon tea and lemon custard. This is a beast of flavor between sweet, savory and downright peppery.   

**Taste:**  Thick and rich. Good heat for the proof, not punishing. Creamy dough, BBQ fish and ribs, salinity is good here and theres nice wine fruit sweetness. Very well balanced in a dram that is historically very easy to get carried away.  

**Finish:** Long, complex. Some growing gentle heat. Sweet, fruity and loaded with smoky BBQ. 

**Overall:** Quite a fan. Octo does it again. I wish it was cheaper so I could buy them all, but that doesnt factor in to the rating. Therefore...an 8!

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
