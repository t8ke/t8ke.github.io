**The Schtick:**  Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit is a single barrel Wild Turkey product aged somewhere from 8.5ish to 9.5ish years. Its bottled at 101 proof with a mashbill consisting of 75% corn, 13% rye and 12% malt.

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** Lukas

**ABV:** 50.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Toffee, sublte oak. Some mild astringency - think acetone, here. Vanilla, toasted almonds, caramel. Smells pretty nice.

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel - about the same as 101 Id say. Not too hot, but there is a sharp ethanol note here. Some tannic oak, faint vanilla and caramel and then a good bit of astringency. Maybe a little cocoa here, but its not wickedly sweet - more oaky and tannic. Im surprised at the lack of corn notes here.

**Finish:** Medium in length and grows drying. Its hotter than Id expect for the proof here. Some sweetness but mostly oaky and tannic here.

**Overall:** Would I take this against WT101? Probably not. But, this is a single barrel product and that is 100% of what makes this series a blast. My better half has now revealed this portion of the blind log and this sample is from Lukas Liquor in Kansas City, MO. It wasnt awful, but it wasnt particularly balanced - and far more oaky and tannic than I would expect from a barrel under 10yrs (and one I would enjoy). Its not bad, but its not exceptional. But, this is only the beginning. Stay tuned for another Kentucky Spirit tomorrow!

Thanks for reading!
