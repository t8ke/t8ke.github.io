[**Review #117 | Bourbon Review #65 - High West Silver Oat**]( https://t8ke.review/review-117-high-west-silver-oat/)

**The Schtick:** Unaged oat whiskey from High West in Park City, Utah. 

-----

**Distiller:** High West

**Bottler:** High West

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Less sweet than the BT unaged mash. A little bit of cream, some astringency, maybe some mild spice. Overall, theres a lot less going on here than I expected there would be, but it also doesnt smell like paint thinner so I think thats a more favorable place to be. 

**Taste:** Oddly bland. Its strange to feel this way for a spirit but I get only a small handful of things. Grain and syrupy sweet, mild acetone and some plastic. 

**Finish:** Its short but not terribly offensive, theres just not a lot going on. Mild sweetness and then it wisps away. 

**Overall:** Nothing too exciting. Not great, not terrible. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
