[**Review #278 | Bourbon Review #278 - High Wests Midwinter Nights Dram Act 2 Scene 2**]( https://t8ke.review/review-278-high-west-midwinters-night-dram-22/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** High West

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 49.3% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Dill, clove, baking spices, spearmint, jammy raspberries and cherry syrup

**Taste:** Sweet but then the rye spice kicks in. Its dilly in that MGP way and its well balanced as some jammy fruity notes come in. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, though. Theres a lot of clove here and much more cinnamon than I get in Acts 3 or 4 (spoiler alert!)

**Finish:** Medium and mildly astringent but not too bad. More clove and rye spice here and far less port notes than in other batches. A good punch of dill too. This one is definitely more rye spirit forward and lets the port and french oak spice take a backseat.

**Overall:** This is a good bottle and a great winter dram but it cant keep up with Act 3 in my book. I love the port influence in MWND and this just doesnt have much at all with the rye spice dominating so much more than Act 3. Its not a bad dram in the least - its very delicious. Im going to give it a Rank 6 - its very high quality spirit but not on par with Act 3 in my mind and cant begin to see eye to eye with the mighty Quady port.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
