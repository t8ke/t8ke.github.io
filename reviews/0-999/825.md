[**Review #825 | Scotch Review #278 - Talisker 10**]( https://t8ke.review/review-825-talisker-10yr/)

**The Schtick:** Talisker 10 is a core line expression released by the Diageo owned Talisker distillery. It is produced on the Island of Skye, where it is the only distillery. Somehow, Ive made it this far without reviewing it, which I figured needed to be fixed since Ive gone through a healthy amount of bottles over the years. 

-----

**Distiller:** Talisker

**Bottler:** Talisker

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 45.8% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich, sweet cream. Brine, pepper, bananas. Lemon icing, butter cream, toffee, creme brulee, floral.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, rich honey. Cream, toffee, salted caramel, apple crisp. Melon. Mild smoke. 

**Finish:** Long, rich, smokey. Pepper, caramels, lemon bar, ashy smoke. Not super smokey, but its there. Blends perfectly with the dessert notes. 

**Overall:** Really, really nice. Youd have no idea this was this young when tasting blind. The sea air, brine, and pepper blend really well with the fruits and dessert notes.  

Thanks for reading!
