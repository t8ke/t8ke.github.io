[**Review #276 | Rye Review #151 - Pikesville Rye 110 proof**]( https://t8ke.review/review-276-pikesville-rye/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Pikesville

**Bottler:** Pikesville

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  55% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Brown sugar, clove, cream, mild spice

**Taste:** Sweet and mild rye spice, lots of molasses, sugar, cream and clove

**Finish:** Medium, hot for the proof. Sweet and spicy. Leaning more towards spice

**Overall:** Good but not really a very punch rye. Its a solid rye, has a nice soft, sweet mouthfeel. Not punishingly harsh or hot but also not wildly complex. To me, this tastes closer to bourbon, than rye. Which is a problem for a product that costs nearer to $50 or $55 near me. Im going to give this a Rank 5

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
