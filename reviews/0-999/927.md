[**Review #927 | Rum Review #51 - Kaniche XO Doublewood Rum**]( https://t8ke.review/review-927-kaniche-xo-double-wood-rum/)

**The Schtick:** This is a Barbados rum that is aged in Panama and matured in two types of casks. It also appears to leave Barbados, bound for Panama, to see some time in a cognac cask as well.  

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Maison Ferrand

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Buttery sweets. Toffee, nutty caramel. Almost a salted caramel feel. Lightly fruity, not super effervescent. More dessert-y with a passion fruit flair.   

**Taste:** Medium to thick, very sweet. Mild heat, but very mild. Buttery, caramel and root beer candies. Bananas, guava and light mango. Lots of caramel and toffee, molasses. Sweet, likely dosed, if only minimally. Proof feels about 43% ABV. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length, mild heat but then its gone. Sweet caramel, maple candies, maple syrup, light tobacco and sweet guava notes. Really focused on the sweet notes. 

**Overall:** I liked this but found it pretty sweet. Id be pretty confident in calling this dosed, at least minimally. I bet it goes very well in a daiquiri with extra lime. Im pretty ok guessing this to be 8-10 years, dosed, 40% ABV - 43% ABV and Guyana or Barbados in origin. 

Thanks for reading!
