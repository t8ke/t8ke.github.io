[**Review #121 | World Review #8 - Hibiki Harmony**]( https://t8ke.review/review-121-hibiki-harmony/)

**The Schtick:** A hyped release in the current hottest trend: whiskey anyone can palate. 

-----

**Distiller:** Hibiki

**Bottler:** Hibiki

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, melons and vine fruit: cantaloupe, watermelon, honeydew, etc. Its fruity, aromatic and light all around. No ethanol whatsoever

**Taste:** The mouth feel is very thin, and its incredibly gentle. Theres more vanilla, some sugary sweet and then a blast of more fruits. I hate the word smooth, but theres no denying it. This is just smooth. Not a whole ton going on here. Its sweet, thin and unoffensive. 

**Finish:** Short, mild and fruity. Theres a lot of butterscotch in this one, much like some Nikka I used to have a bottle of. 

**Overall:** This is easily a one note dram. Its sweet, has no ethanol notes and smooooooooooth which explains why its all the range among many newcomers who want to start with the hottest thing.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
