[**Review #30 | Scotch Review #9 - Aberlour 12yr Double Cask**]( https://t8ke.review/review-30-aberlour-12yr-double-cask/)

**The Schtick:** This is a chill filtered release from Aberlour that is 12 years old. Its time in barrels is split between ex-bourbon and ex-sherry. 

-----

**Distiller:** Aberlour

**Bottler:** Aberlour

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sherry and grapes. Some cherry, some plum, some light floral honey mixed with raspberries. Sweet and inviting. No ethanol whatsoever. 

**Taste:** Very light and fruity, almost a little syrupy, but not too bad. Lots and lots of red fruits here, primarily raspberries and then some sherry notes. Overall, its thin but not offensive. Theres not a lot here, but what is present is very light. 

**Finish:** Not terrible long, but once again its pretty delicate. Theres a little oak, but its mostly fruit again on the way out. Almost no alcohol either, but since its only 80 proof, this makes sense.     

**Overall:** I like this. I want to love it, but Im not feeling like Im getting a whole lot for the money. Going for almost $60 here, Id rather throw in an extra $10 for the NCF or $20 for the Abunadh. Its not bad, but its nothing to go bonkers about. 

Thanks for reading!
