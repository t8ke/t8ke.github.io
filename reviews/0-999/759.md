**The Schtick:** The final cask from our most recent shipment of Old Particular single casks is this lovely little number from Cambus, one of Diageos top grain distilleries until it was closed forever in 1993. That means every bottle of Cambus that gets consumed from this point out moves the whisky a step closer to total extinction! This 25 year old single cask, originally distilled in September of 1991, is a glorious example of both Cambus and grain whisky at its most splendid K&amp;L Wines, as modest as ever. 

-----

**Distiller:** Cambus

**Bottler:** Douglas Laings Old Particular

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:**  62% ABV

**Age:** 25 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Huge banana, peaches and cream, honeydew, melon, musty tobacco, oddly plasticy (like kitchen tupperware), honey and vanilla.

**Taste:** Hot, medium mouthfeel, vanilla, bananas, honey roasted peanuts, faint oak, peach rings and faint melon. 

**Finish:** Long, pretty intense heat but loaded with tons of vanilla and fruits. Its almost rummy, in that I havent had a grain distillate this fruity. Really inpressive and Im loving the honeydew, watermelon, peach rings and banan split craziness. Bonkers weird but I like it.

**Overall:** Fruity, intense, weird. I dig it. Weird and I like it a bunch. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
