**Nose:**  Oak, waffles, toffee. Definitely bourbon. Super rich in the toffee department. Oaky, dry, some pepper. 

**Taste:** Rich and thick. Some heat, but restrained. This is pretty high proof. Oak, toffee and waffle cone. Cocoa, vanilla, honey. Faintly fruity, some strawberries and cream. 

**Finish:** Long, oily and oaky. Rich tobacco, caramel, cereal grains, toffee and more of that faint strawberry fruitiness. 

**Overall:** 

Thanks for reading!
