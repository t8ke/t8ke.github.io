[**Review #731 | AmericanBrandy Review #18 - Germain Robin XO**]( https://t8ke.review/review-731-germain-robin-xo-brandy/)

**The Schtick:** This was sent to me as a blind mystery and it was sampled live in the Whiskey Network Discord where I also got the reveal. I have filled in the relevant info here for convenience. 

-----

**Distiller:** Germain-Robin

**Bottler:** Germain-Robin

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Toffee, faint fruitiness, bitter plastic, vine fruit, molasses. Really effervescent fruitiness 

**Taste:** Thin mouthfeel, vine fruit, some astringency / plastic, clove and pepper with some artificial spice. Grapes, pear, clove, syrupy molasses. Real lack of heat.

**Finish:** Finish: Short, no heat. Faintly syrupy, apple peel, pepper. Faint bitterness but very muted. Overall sweet and fruity. Raisin note like raisin bread

**Overall:** verall: : Overall: it reminds me a lot of the courvosier I had some time ago. my guess is that its a grape based product thats relatively young and bottled at 40-43% ABV. That amount of fruitiness can only be a grape based distillate or maybe a light light dosed guyana rum but Im saying brandy. Not experienced enough to guess a brand but assuming 4-6years, 40-43% ABV. If its rum, its super light and vibrant, but I dont think it is. The fruit lingers way too much.

Thanks for reading!
