[**Review #107 | Bourbon Review #61 - Evan Williams Bottled in Bond**]( https://t8ke.review/review-107-evan-williams-bib/)

**The Schtick:** This is a standard bottled in bond product produced by Evan Williams. 

-----

**Distiller:** Evan Williams

**Bottler:** Evan Williams

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Very sweet, mildly fruity and loaded with vanilla and molasses.  

**Taste:** Theres some cinnamon and wood spice, followed by vanilla and a thicker buttery mouth feel. Good balance of sweet and spice, although the spice is much less prominent. 

**Finish:** Medium to short with some mild heat. Its pretty well balanced though. Maybe a little young, but not offensively so.   

**Overall:** In the end, this isnt half bad. Great nose and palate with a slightly disappointing finish, but nothing tragic. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
