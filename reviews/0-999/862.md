[**Review #862 | Bourbon Review #458 - David James 10yr Straight American Whiskey**]( https://t8ke.review/review-862-david-james-straight-american-whiskey/)

**The Schtick:** This strange, elusive release recently won best Corn Whiskey at the 2018 San Francisco Spirits Competition, which I found interesting. 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Old Georgetown Spirits

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 59.8% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Caramel, honey, banana bread. Vitamins, chalk, rich vanilla, some cream. Faint oak.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, heat in check. Sweet caramel, light toffee. Tobacco, oak, vitamins, orange peel. Mildly oaky, faint cocoa. Overall, I think its remarkably Dickel-esque.

**Finish:** Long, a tad bit hot, loaded with honey and fruits. Nice oak presence. Good flavor helps make punishing heat a little more tolerable.

**Overall:** This was adequately sourced, and performs well, all things considered. I wish there was more info on the what and where that goes into this, but it performs well on the palate, and thats what matters at the end of the day. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
