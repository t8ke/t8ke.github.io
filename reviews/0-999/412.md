[**Review #412 | Scotch Review #161 - North British Distillery 50yo Grain Whiskey**]( https://t8ke.review/review-412-north-british-50yr-grain/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 50 year old grain whiskey from North British distillery, bottled at cask strength.

-----

**Distiller:** North British  

**Bottler:** Sovereign

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 44.7% ABV

**Age:** 50 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, some cake. Caramel, some faint oak. Some coffee notes. Its oddly muted, with only some sweet, bready notes coming through in force. 

**Taste:**  Thin, but sweet and no heat. Caramel, vanilla, some astringency and tannins. Odd plastic note couples with some big vanilla notes and a faint hint of smoke. Its not big abrasive smoke, but a nice, subtle ashy smoke. Like a very muted Caol Ila. 

**Finish:**  Short but sweet and also faintly smokey. No astringency here and some nice vanilla lives on. 

**Overall:**  This is an interesting dram. Its not huge, or bold, but nicely nuanced. There were one or two notes that I didnt love, but overall it managed to be quite pleasant. It wasnt particularly notable but Im happy to see that for the age, it is not a disgusting bitter tannic oak bomb. Im also impressed that the proof is still that "high" after so many years. I expected a barely legal proof, but this had some nice depth due to the extra couple of percent. To date, this is the oldest whiskey Ive tried and it didnt disappoint. I wish there was a bit more going on in the palate. Im giving this a 6. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
