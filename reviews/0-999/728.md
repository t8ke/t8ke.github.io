[**Review #728 | Bourbon Review #409 - Orphan Barrel: Forged Oak**]( https://t8ke.review/review-728-orphan-barrel-forged-oak/)

**The Schtick:** This was sent to me as a blind mystery and it was sampled live in the Whiskey Network Discord where I also got the reveal. I have filled in the relevant info here for convenience. 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Diageo

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 45.25% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Molasses, clove, maple, allspice. Vanilla, toffee, oak. Quintessential bourbon notes, a bit corn forward. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, no real heat. Fruity, lots of clove and pepper. Allspice, maple, vanilla and tobacco. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length, fruity orange, caramel and toffee. 

**Overall:** This was interesting, as it didnt really stand out in too many ways other than being a very bourbon-y bourbon. Im guessing that it is a bourbon that is 8-11 years in age, with an ABV of 45% -50%. It is not Beam distillate, nor is it Buffalo Trace distillate. Perhaps Heaven Hill. Im going to give it a 5/10 - solid.

Thanks for reading!
