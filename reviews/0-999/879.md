**Bottler:** Plantation

**Selection:** NASA

**ABV:** 40.6% ABV

-----

**Nose:**  Cocoa, leather, honey, toffee. Sweet amaretto. Creamy vanilla, some nice fruitiness here but nothing super funky. Maple. 

**Taste:** Sweet, rich, caramel. Tons of sweetness here. Rich, supple, maple. Brown sugar, tobacco, amaretto. Light fruitiness. Almonds. 

**Finish:** Short, sweet and nutty. Creamy vanilla. Cocoa, faint fruitiness. The cognac and malt whiskey casks are pretty evident, given the sweetness. 

**Overall:** This was really nice, and completely different than I expected. Definitely a great sipper.

Thanks for reading!
