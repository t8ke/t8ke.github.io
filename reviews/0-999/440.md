**The Schtick:** This is the final phase of Gobble Til You Wobble and Ill be looking at both the Bourbon and Ryes that are sold under that line. Bourbons first, ryes second. This is a modern offering from Wil Turkey with the higher entry proof. It is diluted to 110 pf and sold as a single barrel offering across the nation. Many stores have been able to do picks of these products, and extra information is available as a result. It is, still, a NAS product, though.

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** Gallensteins

**ABV:**  55% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, cream, fruity and a good deal of citrus. Faint ethanol, some mild spice, most notably baking spice and some gentle cocoa.  

**Taste:** Rich and thick. Very nice mouthfeel, lots of fruit. Cloves and creamy vanilla are big notes here with very muted Turkey spice. Its sweet and creamy and fruity with a gentle movement towards growing spiciness - like cinnamon and cracked pepper. 

**Finish:** Medium in length, no heat. Sweet and fruity gives to lots of cocoa. 

**Overall:** I really think this was a nice pick. Its amazing how all over the place it was, though. First sweet, then fruity, then spicy, then back to creamy. Overall, you cant go wrong with it though. This is revealed to be the Gallensteins Pick, which is my first pick from them. I really enjoyed the richness of the mouthfeel, though, which made it stand out to me against other turkey Ive had before. 

Thanks for reading!
