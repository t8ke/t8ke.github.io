[**Review #499 | Rye Review #283 - Michters Toasted Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-499-michters-toasted-rye-2017/)

**The Schtick:** This is an extension of Michters Toasted series - originally only offered in a bourbon release. 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Michters

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 54.2% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Fruity in a strange way. Strawberry, lemon, orange peel. Oaky, cocoa and caramel. Theres an artificial splenda and mint note also. Sort of reminiscent of MM46.  

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, some heat. Clove, oak and tannins. Minty artificial spearmint, orange zest, pine and spruce. Very dry. You may be thinking MGP by the minty note, but I dont think this has any Indiana provenance. Its the return of the artificial splenda/mint note I get in some other products. Its strange and artificial. 

**Finish:** Short, oaky and a total mint bomb. Artificial splenda persists. 

**Overall:** This is a really unique pour. Unfortunately, its not the kind of unique that tickles my palate (in a good way). In a world where the regular Michters Barrel Proof rye exists, this is a pass for me, 100 out of 100 times. 

Thanks for reading!
