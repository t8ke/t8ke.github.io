**The Schtick:** Four Roses Private Selects are arguably the best value in bourbon. Producing 10 different recipes regularly bottles at cask strength, plenty of variety is available to even the average consumer.  

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** Norfolk Wine and Spirits

**ABV:**  58% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, butter cream, caramel, toffee and a hint of oak. Almost sweet / savory combo of notes. 

**Taste:**  Medium oakiness, with a mildly rich mouthfeel. Middle of the road Id say. Sweet caramel, bitter floral notes and some cocoa. Really leans towards the peppery, cocoa, oaky, bitter side of the spectrum.

**Finish:** Medium in length but some really fierce heat. Theres some brief sweetness in the form of vanilla and caramel, but the oaky peppery cocoa and tannins dominate. 

**Overall:** Its not bad, but its a bit too tannic, oaky, and bitter for me to really sing its praises. Its just fine. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
