[**Review #762 | Bourbon Review #422 - Barrell Whiskey Batch 004 Rum Finish**]( https://t8ke.review/review-762-barrell-whiskey-batch-004/)

**The Schtick:** This is a sourced bourbon that is finished in rum casks, released under the Barrel line. Coincidentally, this is the same as a blind sample I had a couple weeks ago. I have several more batches of Barrell Whiskey and Bourbon so this will be the first entry in a mini series of sorts. 

-----

**Distiller:** Dickel

**Bottler:** Barrell

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 61.25% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet honey, gingerbread, vanilla and caramel, really sweet vanilla and a hint of rum funk. 

**Taste:** Medium, definite rum funkiness, some heat. Sweet caramel, deep pepper, toffee and rich over ripe bananas. Heat is searing, though. Definitely high proof. 

**Finish:** Long, really nice estery rum funk springs to life here. Blending with some heavy clove ans vanilla influence, this is really delicious and interesting. Definitely finished in an estery rum. 

**Overall:** A bit hot but totally good and totally fascinating. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
