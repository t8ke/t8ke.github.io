[**Review #637 | Scotch Review #217 - Oban Little Bay**]( https://t8ke.review/review-637-oban-little-bay/)

**The Schtick:** I have previously reviewed Oban Distillers Edition and Oban 14 but never Little Bay. This is a single malt from Oban that is a marriage of single casks that are further aged in 200 liter ex-bourbon hogsheads.

**Distiller:** Oban

**Bottler:** Oban

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**   Honey, fresh baked bread. Vanilla and cream. Faint salinity. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, no real heat. Vanilly and fresh grains. Fresh baked breads, almost like a Krisy Kreme. Caramel. Faint pepper. Very bready overall. 

**Finish:** Short with no heat. Its all sweet and sort of relies on the baked bread, yeasty, cake-y one trick.

**Overall:** This was good but not really interesting. Thats not a flaw, but its hard to rate super high since its the same from nose to finish. Still good though, and Id pick it up locally if it wasnt priced out the wazoo (which it is).

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
