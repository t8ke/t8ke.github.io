**The Schtick:** You dont need to know the schtick on this because everyone has beat it to death in the last several weeks. Its 16yo sourced rye at cask strength and a triple digit price tag. 

-----

**Distiller:** Alberta

**Bottler:** Hochstadters

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 61.9% ABV

**Age:** 16 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Fruity, with lots of clove. A nice touch of oak is there with lots of caramel, toffee, cocoa and an ethanol punch. 

**Taste:** Thick mouthfeel that is nice and oily. Its rich and fruity. Lots of caramel. Its definitely the alberta profile, I could tell that blind any day, but theres a lot of good balance with some tannins and oak coming in. Overall, the sweet and fruity notes are well balanced.   

**Finish:** Long, lots of oak and cocoa. Really drying.  

**Overall:**  I like it a whole lot. Im ranking it up near some of my favorite WhistlePig and THH but Id probably take THH over this if they were both handed to me for me to pick. I think this is a good product, but I wont be tripping over myself to go buy some at $160+

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
