**The Schtick:** Four Roses releases single barrels of a specific recipe at cask strength as their private pick program. 

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses 

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** Cork Dorks

**ABV:** 54.7% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Big honey and caramel, butter scotch and light floral notes. Emphasis on the honey. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich, heat in check. Sweet honey, caramel, cinnamon and sugar toast. Floral, OESK giveaway notes. Faint pepper and some really nice oak. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet toffee and a nice dry finish. 

**Overall:** Dang. This is nice. I find oak can sometikes tear an OESK apart, but the balance between sweet, floral and oak here is really very nice. Super delish. 

Thanks for reading!
