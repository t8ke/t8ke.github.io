**The Schtick:** Gin made by Barton, a primary name connected to bourbon? How bad could it be? This was on sale for $3.99, so yolo. 

-----

**Distiller:** Barton

**Bottler:** Barton

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Ethanol, juniper, confectioners sugar. Lemon poppy seed muffin. 

**Taste:** Thin, but no heat. Which is reassuring for 40% ABV. Lightly earthy, creamy vanilla, confectioners sugar and citrus rind. 

**Finish:** Short, thin, no real heat. Lemon, lime, white pepper, light sweetness, some juniper. 

**Overall:** Overall, really not bad. Not impressive, certainly not great but I expected faaaaar far worse from something like this. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
