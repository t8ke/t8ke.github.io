[**Review #740 | World Review #30 - Domaines des Haute Glaces Organic Single Malt Whisky**]( https://t8ke.review/review-740-domaines-des-haute-glaces-organic-single-malt-whisky/)

**The Schtick:** This is single malt whisky distilled at the Alpine Farm Distillery at Domaine des Haute Glaces in France. It appears to use a solera style vatting system, and does not carry an age statement. It also advertises its Organic status on the label as well.

**Distiller:** Alpine Farms

**Bottler:** Alpine Farms

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  42% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Honey, waxy fruits, malty and super perfumey. It also smelly very young - some rough grain, damp moist earth and a tinge of astringency.  

**Taste:** Musty, young wet cardboard, apples, pears and faint astringency. The fruits are sweet - good vanilla and a nice waxy fruit characteristic. 

**Finish:** Short, growing heat and continuation of the vibrant waxy fruit notes. 

**Overall:** Unfortunately, I think this has potential but its relative youth is stopping it from performing better. The vibrant fruits, floral notes and the waxiness is really enjoyable (almost akin to a very young Clynelish, mmmmmm) but the youth, heat and astringency counteracts some of those positive notes. I think that with more age, this will perform much better, but for now, its still just a bit too young.

Thanks for reading!
