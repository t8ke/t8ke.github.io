**Distiller:** Auchentoshan

**Bottler:** Auchentoshan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Massive fruity sherry blast. Really reminds me of a more subdued Macallan 12, the raisins, plums, dark fruit and sugary sweetness are all there. A bit of cream too.

**Taste:** Its delicious and well blended - although theres a lot of fruit it doesnt seem overpowering. Theres a lot of brown sugar as well. I get a funky note near the end though, much like charred wood and a hint of burnt rubber which I think is really, really odd. It seems out of place, but it doesnt remind me of other smokey characteristics from some other drams Ive tried. Hmm.

**Finish:** Nice and long, smooth and sweet. The wood/rubber note is back though and it quickly overpowers the sweet fruit. I dont hate it though, it fits a little better into the mix here than on the tongue.

**Overall:** The jurys still out for me. I like the flavors and its a bit different than a usual whiskey of its type. I still (burn me at the stake, whatever) prefer Macallan 12 and Glendronach 12 but this was far from a bad dram.

Thanks for reading!
