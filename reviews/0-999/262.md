**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Glenfiddich

**Bottler:** Glenfiddich

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Apples, pears, brown sugar, caramel, toffee and very faint thin vanilla sweetness

**Taste:** Thin mouthfeel, sweet apples and pears. Honey and very light cereal grains. Faint caramel. Its oddly hot though, and mildly astringent for something at the lowest legal proof. Hmm.

**Finish:**  Medium, with a surprisingly rich mouthfeel. Its hot though, more of that funny odd heat despite the low proof. Lots of apple, sweet pear and a thin vein of caramel.

**Overall:** This is a great beginner dram and I have no regrets with starting on it when I had just gotten started. Back then, the price was too good to resist, something like $42 and its crept up quite a bit since then. This is a gentle, fruity and approachable dram and Id reccommend it for anyone trying to investigate whether single malts are for them. It doesnt stand out for any one exceptional characteristic but on the whole, its a quintessential starter dram. For all of these reasons, Im giving this a Rank 5.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
