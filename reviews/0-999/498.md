[**Review #498 | Scotch Review #181 - Old Pulteney 12yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-498-old-pulteney-12yr/)

**The Schtick:** This is the youngest expression in Old Pulteneys core line of age stated products. I have reviewed the 30yr before, and found it to be delicious. 

-----

**Distiller:** Old Pulteney

**Bottler:** Old Pulteney

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Honey, bread, bakery sweets. Faint brine, sea breeze, lemon tart and some gentle pepper. 

**Taste:** Sweet butter cream. Medium mouthfeel. Faint brine and the sea, honey and pears. This is a delicious, gentle blending of sweets, faint fruitiness and a nice touch of brine. 

**Finish:** Medium, no heat. Lemons, apples, pears. Brine, honey and toffee. Its sweet, fruity and salty in an impressively complex blend.

**Overall:** I like this. Its a little on the light side, but its enjoyable and notably very complex. 

Thanks for reading!
