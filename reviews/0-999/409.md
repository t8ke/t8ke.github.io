[**Review #409 | Bourbon Review #409 - Bowman Single Barrel**]( https://t8ke.review/review-409-bowman-single-barrel-loch-and-key/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** Loch and Key

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 14 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet toffee, caramel, syrupy chocolate cherry cordials. Really nice and sweet, some faint oak but not dominating. Pleasant.

**Taste:** Nice mouthfeel for the proof. Nicely oaky and fruity - almost like eagle rare here. Little more oak though. Pleasant toffee, caramel, cocoa. This is really nice. Heat is very tame, if existent at all.

**Finish:** Medium to long. Very minimal heat. Grows very oaky but not overly tannic. Cocoa, toffee and some seeet caramel are here too.

**Overall:** This is my first taste in a long while of the bowman single barrel and i dont remember it being this thick and loaded with flavor. This is a really nice pick that demonstrates that some oak can do a profile good without becoming a tannic bitter mess. I really enjoyed this.

Thanks for reading!
