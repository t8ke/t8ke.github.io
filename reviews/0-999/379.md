**The Schtick:**  Wild Turkey 101 is a NAS offering bottled at 101proof. The mash is standard but barrel entry proof varies based on the era in which the barrels were laid down.

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Thick, rich caramel. Much less clove, a little dankness to it. Sweet, doughy. has a lot of the same notes, ironically, as the 61 crown I have. really caramel forward.

**Taste:** Almost no heat, whatsoever. Noticeably thicker than the 2004. Less clove, less spice. More tobacco, caramel, toffee. Noticeably sweeter. A funky little hint of orange or lemon zest. Absolutely turkey but a hair different. Bit of cocoa.

**Finish:** Medium, pretty mild. Little clove, mild astringency. Very musty and sweet.

**Overall:** This is very different than modern WT101. I think I like it a bit better than the 2004 but its also not as bright as todays product. I think its good, Im really a sucker for sweets so this is nice but it could get cloying after a dram or two without that really noticeable Turkey spice to even it out. Im going to give this a Rank 7. Id be content with a bottle and I did really enjoy this.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
