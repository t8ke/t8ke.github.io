**Distiller:** Ballechin

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage

**Selection:** Vintage Wines

**ABV:** 54.6% ABV

**Age:** 11 Years

**Nose:**   Toffee, vanilla, cream, pepper, caramels, salted wafers, mild smoke, faint oak. Interesting smoke component, a little dessert-y. Lots of potential.

**Taste:** Medium, creamy, caramel, toffee, raisins, oak, pepper, ash smoke, telephone pole. Theres some peat here, but its not super unique. Very ashy, woody, faint tar. No sea air, medicinal iodine, or meaty quality. Blends very nicely though with the toffee / raisin prominence in the palate. 

**Finish:** Long, ashy, caramel, goes on for a substantial period of time. Not too much heat in the finish.

**Overall:** This was a really nice balance of caramel, ash, and toffee. I liked it quite a bit. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
