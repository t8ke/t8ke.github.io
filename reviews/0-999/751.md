**The Schtick:** This is a 10 year old single barrel of rye whiskey sourced from Alberta and aged in Vermont. It was selected by Lukas Liquor in Kansas.

-----

**Distiller:** Alberta

**Bottler:** Whistle Pig

**Selection:** Lukas

**ABV:** 57.5% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, graham cracker, cereal and vanilla. Faint fruit loop presence as well. Nice fruity combined with sweet.

**Taste:** Thick, rich with only mild heat. Graham crackers are prevalent, smores, waffles and cloves are also prominent. This is closely followed by significant fruitiness - loads of cherry, melon and raspberry. This balances really well with a nice rye spice. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and loaded with vanilla, cereal grains and more fruit. 

**Overall:** Another really great showing from Whistle Pig. They sure know how to pick them. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
