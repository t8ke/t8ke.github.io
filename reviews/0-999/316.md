[**Review #316 | Scotch Review #131 - Imperial 15yr Gordon &amp; MacPhail Port Finish**]( https://t8ke.review/review-316-imperial-15yr-port-gordon-macphail/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Imperial

**Bottler:** Gordon MacPhail

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Jam, berries, some clove, some cinnamon, some nice pastry desserts

**Taste:** Strongly jammy, lots of berry, fudge, char. Smokey, jammy, delicious. Little bit of oaky woodiness.

**Finish:** Long but smokey and jammy. I love this balance, like someone smoked a jar of smuckers. Delicious.

**Overall:** For an unpeated malt, this is oddly charred and smokey and I love it. I think it integrates very well from the strong jammy fruity berry notes and makes for a great balance. Im giving this a Rank 7. I wish they werent closed because I want a lot more of this.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
