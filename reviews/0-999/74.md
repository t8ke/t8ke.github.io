[**Review #74 | Scotch Review #27 - Benromach 10**]( https://t8ke.review/review-74-benromach-10/)

**The Schtick:** This is Benromachs entry to their age stated line of products. 

-----

**Distiller:** Benromach

**Bottler:** Benromach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Smokey, fruity and sweet. Mild pear and apple with a healthy smokey tone.      

**Taste:** Its a little smokey, theres some mild salty/ salted caramel notes. Mild fruitiness as well. All in all, this dram just tastes....mild. Theres some yummy dark chocolate at the end though. Its not bad, but it doesnt have an amazing amount of character.  

**Finish:** Its short - medium. The finish is smokey and satisfying and quite enjoyable, despite anything notable taste wise. 

**Overall:** Im less impressed with this dram than many other mildly smokey drams Ive had. Its not bad, but its also not that noteworthy. A good middle of the road glass if something mild and a little smokey is what youre after. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
