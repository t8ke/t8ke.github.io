**The Schtick:** This is a blend of two agaves, distilled in Oaxaca. It features 90% Mexicano Agave and 10% Espadin Agave. The Mezcalero is Aquilino Garcia Lopes, distilled in the village of Candelariaa. It was stone ground and distilled using a copper still.

**Nose:**  Vinegar, salt and pepper. Beets, earthy, sour and lactic. Earthy terroir is really prominent here as well as some grass, floral, fruitiness. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, some heat. Faintly smoky (ashy) with some pepper. Sweet cream, burnt rubber. Really interesting juxtaposition of smoky and sweet. 

**Finish:** Short, peppery and smoky with a faint vanilla and citrus character on the exit. 

**Overall:** This is definitely unique, and good, but it wasnt my favorite so far. 

Thanks for reading!
