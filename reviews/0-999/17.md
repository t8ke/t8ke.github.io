[**Review #17 | Bourbon Review #15 - Knob Creek 9yr Small Batch**]( https://t8ke.review/review-17-knob-creek-small-batch-9yr/)

**The Schtick:** This is the entry level, 9 year age stated Knob Creek product released by Beam Suntory. 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Ethanol and corn with a nice heavy dose of vanilla and cinnamon. Im getting a little caramel here but not a whole lot. The ethanol is strangely overpowering, despite sitting for about 20 minutes in a Glencairn.  

**Taste:** Theres a whole heap of caramel and cinnamon, followed by a whallop of alcohol. This tastes rough, despite its age. If this was blind, Id guess its a much younger bourbon. 

**Finish:** Short and hot. Theres just no other way to put it. I want to like this bourbon but theres more ethanol here than a lot of other high caliber drams and its just not as pleasant as the price tag would lull you into trying to believe.   

**Overall:** Ive been drinking this for the better part of 6 months, at all different fill levels hoping that this bourbon will even out but its just not happening.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
