-----

**Distiller:** Chateau de Pellehaut

**Bottler:** Chateau de Pellehaut

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 49.8% ABV

**Age:** 31 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Deep oaky bourbon notes. Brown sugar, maple, caramel, peach cobble, blackberry jam. The complexity here is impressive.  

**Taste:** Sweet and syrupy, almost like Dole syrupy. Fruit abounds here like a fruit cocktail, oaky and tannic blending nicely with cocoa. The sweetness is really apparent here, but the oak that I usually find too dominating is a great blender here. The two extremes balance nicely, preventing it from being either cloying or too dry. 

**Finish:** Medium with more sweetness surviving. Oak is present here also, but the stewed fruits win out in the end. 

**Overall:** There were a lot of directions this could have gone, but it wasnt oak dominated and this was the kicker. The finish was particularly nice, ending on a faintly sweet note rather than a bitter, dry, tannic one. 

Thanks for reading!
