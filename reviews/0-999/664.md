**The Schtick:** This is a blend of two sherried Glenfarclas casks that are blended and bottled at cask strength. It is bottled for The Whiskey Exchange. 

-----

**Distiller:** Glenfarclas

**Bottler:** Glenfarclas

**Selection:** The Whiskey Exchange

**ABV:** 51.1% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Grassy and floral, bready and loaded with sweet bakery notes. Sticky, syrupy sherry, stewed fruits and a hint of citrus peel. This is really interesting and super unique. Its very evidently to be heavily sherried but the grassy floral notes and citrus peel really lend some nice nuance.

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel with some heat. At first there is some vanilla and a strange, almost corn, note. Weird. And then the dominant sherry really rolls in. Clove, tobacco, stewed fruits, figs and raspberries, and a load of toffee. The palate opens up very nicely with some extra resting time, and is a really cocoa forward sherry bomb.   

**Finish:** Medium length with some heat. Peppery, earthy and loaded with syrupy sherry notes. Figs are back, as are the stone fruits. 

**Overall:** Theres something a little strange in the palate, but not bad strange. Just a hair off. The rest of the dram is a really enjoyable sherry experience though, and was super interesting to try. Im giving this a Rank 6, which I feel is justified since it seems a little scattered at first, but comes through with a real strong finish. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
