**The Schtick:** This is a release from Edradour, a distillery owned by Signatory Vintage. It is aged in Super Tuscan casks, which is a blend of red wines. It is bottled at cask strength and was selected by Specs in Texas.

-----

**Distiller:** Edradour

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage

**Selection:** Specs

**ABV:** 59.1% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, cherries, leather, tobacco and a nice nutty sweetness. Stewed fruits, also very bread-y. Rich, sweet toffee, currants and apple pie. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, some heat. Sweet cocoa, currants and toffee. Nutty caramel, lots of pepper in here too.

**Finish:** Medium but a lot of heat here. Sweet tobacco, clove, pepper and some cocoa.

**Overall:** I liked this and was really posed to throw a 7 out but the finish was pretty hot, and overall I felt like the earthy character kind of dominated. Im going to give this a 6, which is still very respectable. Im loving what Edradour is doing, especially all of these fun finishes. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
