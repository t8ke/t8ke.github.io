[**Review #81 | Scotch Review #31 - The GlenDronach Cask Strength (Batch 3)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-81-the-glendronach-cask-strength-batch-3/)

**The Schtick:** This is a NAS release from GlenDronach bottled at cask strength. It is quite a bit cheaper than their single casks ($85) which makes it a promising entry in their product line. 

-----

**Distiller:** GlenDronach

**Bottler:** GlenDronach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 54.8% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Caramel, peanuts and peanut brittle, some sherry and woody notes.   

**Taste:** Theres a good balance of sherry, wood and spice here. Some nougat-y, caramel notes followed by a light peanut brittle note at the end. Reminds me of a nice Payday bar in a bottle with some caramel and a high proof. 

**Finish:** Medium and mildly hot but theres a lot more sweetness in the finish. Some wood and spice and a light bit of vanilla and caramel.

**Overall:** I hadnt heard a lot about this before I bought it but Im glad I did. Well worth the price of the bottle and Ill be very sad when its gone. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
