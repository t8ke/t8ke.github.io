[**Review #164 | Rye Review #89 - Jim Beam Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-164-jim-beam-rye/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Spicey and loaded with clove. Cinnamon, maple, some piney flavor, mild nuttiness. 

**Taste:** Spicey and warming. Mild metallic, plasticy notes. Molasses and cinnamon swoop back in. Not hugely sweet but well balanced. I can see this being great for cocktails, much like Rittenhouse Rye BiB 

**Finish:** Medium and not as hot as the palate would have led me to predict. Spicey still and satisfyingly so. Mild sweetness here but the spicey is the name of the game thats only backed up by maple and the molasses.   

**Overall:** This goes for absurdly cheap around me. Im not sure what Id take in a fight between Rittenhouse or this since Ritt is a bit pricier by a few bucks but both are great. Id love to try some cocktails with this one as well to compare. All in all, as long as you keep your expectations in check (a L is $26), it performs well for what it was meant to do. Id drink this as an everyday rye for the price and what it brings to the table at that price.

Thanks for reading!
