**The Schtick:**  Wild Turkey 101 is a NAS offering bottled at 101proof. The mash is standard but barrel entry proof varies based on the era in which the barrels were laid down.

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Grains, caramel, toffee. Almost some nice salted caramel. Theres a bit of ethanol here but its balanced nicely with some coffee, caramel and vanilla. Really rich and well blended. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, clove and spice are here in spades. Lots of vanilla and toffee. 

**Finish:** Short, theres some heat here but it quickly fades to blend nicely with the sweet notes. 

**Overall:** This is nice. Not as complex as some, but also richer than some. Im not sure what to peg it as but I do like it more than last reviews so Im going to rank it a 6. That one did seem to be an odd outlier but this is definitely modern, even if its not the most modern iteration. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
