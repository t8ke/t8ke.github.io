[**Review #143 | Bourbon Review #80 - Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (Batch 9)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-143-elijah-craig-barrel-proof-batch-9/)

**The Schtick:** This is a moderately elusive release from Elijah Craig, which is Heaven Hill distillate bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 62.8% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Backing off the proof again a tiny bit. Lots of oak. Lots of vanilla. Lots of maple and some cocoa. 

**Taste:** This one is hot - reminds me more of the batch 4 than anything but not punishing. Cocoa heavy with a good balance of vanilla and molasses. Cherry is faint and way in the back here. Sad.

**Finish:** Long and complex but still not punishing. This one reminds me of a good maple syrup: dark and sweet in one big rush. I think this batch has the least cherry of the ones Ive tasted, which I was really starting to like. The molasses and vanilla and cherry all played very well together. I do however love how strong the molasses and maple are here, so Im not too disappointed.

**Overall:** Some more noticeable change here but nothing negative. Full on delicious.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
