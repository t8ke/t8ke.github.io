**The Schtick:** This is a Mashbill 1 product from Buffalo Trace. Like all of their CEHT products, this is bottled in bond, bottled at 50% and additionally features their low rye mashbill (mashbill is not always consistent across the EHT line).

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Sugary sweetness, what smells to be a healthy serving of brown sugar. Theres a load of  vanilla and caramel as well. Im amazed at how well this nose carries compared to my previous review of another 100pf bourbon. This is complex and buttery, well blended and inviting. 

**Taste:** The mouthfeel is pretty solid, it coats well although it does feel a bit on the watery side. It tastes complex, and the nose doesnt lie. Caramel and vanilla give way to a nice clean buttery finish. Theres some notes of faint cinnamon and savory pepper, but theyre faint and lurking. 

**Finish:** Medium to long. It fades slowly, with almost no harshness to speak of. Im left with nothing but sweet caramel and looking forward to the next taste. 

**Overall:** This bourbon reminds me with great similarity to SAOS 10yr bourbon and after comparing their mashbills online, it makes a lot of sense. Both are fairly solid drams. For a 100pf dram, its deceptively kind and 100% delicious.   

Thanks for reading!
