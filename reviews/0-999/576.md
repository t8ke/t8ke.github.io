**The Schtick:**  Knob Creek Single Barrels have long been a product easily available at most stores. In the last several years, picking private barrels of various ages has become more commonplace. Picks between 9 and 16 years of age have been popping up with great regularity and Ive taken it upon myself to try a variety and see how they fare. Some time ago, Knob Creek exhibited what may have been the largest barrel variation commonly agreed on in the bourbon community with some barrels ranging from wretched to godly. It has been my feeling that, as of late, the overall quality of these barrels being picked has risen, adding a slightly higher floor than existed before.

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** Lincoln Road

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Prominent brown sugar and maple / molasses. Its like a dessert bomb. Reeses Peanut Butter Cup, butter cream, faint oak, faint pepper, sweet and creamy. Not at all what I expected.

**Taste:** Thick, sweet and loads of cocoa. Caramel, more Reeses here. Oak, but its balanced. Sweet dessert notes like toffee, nougat, peanut brittle with faint pepper and oak. 

**Finish:** Long, slightly more oaky but it balances well with the fudge, tobacco and caramel in the finish. 

**Overall:** I had concerns this would be a bitter bomb, but Im really kind of shocked its not. This is sweeter than some younger barrels, more lively than other older than average barrels (think 12/13 years) and completely enjoyable throughout. The PB note is super unique, but fits the profile really well. Pretty impressed by this overall. 

Thanks for reading!
