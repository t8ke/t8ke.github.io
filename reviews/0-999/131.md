[**Review #131 | Bourbon Review #70 - Old Fitzgerald Prime (1995)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-131-old-fitzgerald-prime-1995/)

**The Schtick:** This is an old iteration of Old Fitzgerald Prime, speculated to have been distilled and aged at the legendary Stitzel-Weller distillery. 

-----

**Distiller:** Stitzel-Weller

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Caramel, vanilla, cinnamon and a good deal of leather spice. Not too punchy in one direction or another and very mild. For the proof, this makes sense.

**Taste:** It has a thin mouth feel that presents vanilla and some oaky character right away up front. Minor caramel, theres some good cinnamon and molasses. Gentle and well blended for a bottom shelfer. 

**Finish:**  The finish is short-medium in duration and surprisingly not harsh. I dont know if this is a result of the age, the supposed S-W characteristics and quality or what, but its very drinkable. Enjoyable even.

**Overall:** Its a solid bourbon. I dont see a reason to pay an absurd amount of money for it, but Im pleasantly surprised overall. This was mild, delicious and for a bottom shelf product, very drinkable. Its always cool to drink history.

Thanks for reading!
