**The Schtick:** This is a single cask from Benriach. It is 20 years old, bottled at cask strength and heavily peated while also being sherry matured. 

-----

**Distiller:** BenRiach

**Bottler:** BenRiach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 51.7% ABV

**Age:** 20 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Big, moist, peat slap. Earthy bandaids, jammy fruits like raspberry, fig and date. Ash, cocoa, syrupy sweetness.  

**Taste:** Thick, rich, no heat. Sherry is really prominent and is blended with pretty great complexity in with the peat. Raspberry, strawberry and cherry preserve is sticky sweet in with the peat - blends just right. Ashy, dry, earthy peat in the backend.

**Finish:** Long, earthy and peaty. Almost meaty. Faint fruits on the departure. 

**Overall:** Woo baby, this was great. I think I might have really gone bonkers if this was peated and port finished but this was no slouch. Really impressive dram for sure. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
