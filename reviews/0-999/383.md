[**Review #383 | Rum Review #383 - Golden Devil Single Cask Hampden 24yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-383-golden-devil-single-cask-hampden-24yr/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Hampden

**Bottler:** Golden Devil Single Casks

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 24 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Funky, meaty, overripe fruit. This smells like a whallop of pit bbq followed by salinity and delicious earthy sweetness.   

**Taste:** The nose is spot on to what Id imagine for the palate. Sweet, rich mouthfeel that is a complete funk bomb. This tastes like I image the 1970s felt. Funk-o-rama. It is delicious though. The bbq meat notes pair really well with some nutty earthiness and a great apricot, pineapple, passion fruit toffee sweetness.     

**Finish:** Long. Rich and complex. No heat, but the flavor lasts for a long time.

**Overall:** Goes deliciously well with pistachio nuts. Random bit of trivia there. This is an incredible bottle and I wish I bought many, rather than merely splitting one with a friend. The complexity here is out of this world and if you like funky rums, this is an absolute must try.     

Thanks for reading!
