[**Review #210 | Bourbon Review #119 - Barrell Bourbon Batch 5 **]( https://t8ke.review/review-210-barrell-bourbon-batch-5/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Dickel

**Bottler:** Barrell

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 62.35% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Fruity and full of spice like clove and cinnamon. Surprising lack of major, stereotypical notes like caramel, vanilla, etc

**Taste:** Fruity and sweet. Almost creamy, heavy on the butter cream, fruit like raspberry, blackberry, some minor banana dough. A bit of vanilla and molasses peek in towards the end though and bring a more standard bourbon profile to light. For the proof its not too hot on the tongue and coats nicely. 

**Finish:**  Long and heavy. More typical with brown sugar and clove fighting through the fruit medley. Its really an interesting dram and one thats fairly 

**Overall:** I went into this partial bottle pretty blind since this was the first Barrel product Ive had. I was pleasantly surprised just how different the profile was and how complex it became, especially for Dickel distillate. It was a nice look into an atypical bourbon profile that I came to thoroughly enjoy. I wont likely go out and get a bottle of my own since its pretty pricey but it was a nice glimpse into new, unique profiles. For these reasons, Im rating this dram a 6. Its great and has no major flaws but was more of an adventure to me. I dont think Id take this over some other heavy hitters in the Rank 7 category on my shelf if I really had the choice - especially for the prices. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
