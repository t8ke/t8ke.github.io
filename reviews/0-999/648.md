**The Schtick:** This is a 16 year expression, distilled at Linkwood and bottled by Gordon &amp; MacPhail after being finished in a Cote-Rotie. For those that are not familiar with Cote-Rotie, it is an AOC northern Rhone wine region that produces Syrah and Viognier grapes. 

-----

**Distiller:** Linkwood

**Bottler:** Gordon MacPhail

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** 16 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Toffee, clove, very rich. Stewed fruits. Honey and cocoa, figs, strawberry and jammy raspberry. Faint, earthy tobacco.    

**Taste:** Thick and rich with no real heat. Honey and vanilla followed by tobacco and some stewed fruits and pepper. There is a faint earthiness to it. The fruits are really rich, but blend really well with the earthy notes and the honey and vanilla. 

**Finish:** Long, some faint bitterness, but mostly very good. The stewed fruits and the sweetness and pepper are a great blend here. 

**Overall:** I really liked this quite a lot. This was my first Linkwood, and the finish was very complimentary. What struck me most was the phenomenal balance of each element.

Thanks for reading!
