**The Schtick:** This was a mystery sample sent to me by /u/ethanized. I tasted it, took notes, and then messaged them to him for reveal. I got a little caught up in trying to guess and forgot to think of a 1-10 score, so for these I decided to simplify things into one of five categories:

-----

**Distiller:** Caol Ila

**Bottler:** Douglas Laings Old Particular

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:** 51.9% ABV

**Age:** 33 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet vanilla, lemon bar. Rich buttery vanilla butter cream. Faint salinity, some rich smoldering peat. This is going to be good. 

**Taste:** Medium thickness, vanilla is prominent with sweet lemon lime dessert bar notes here also. Very nice butter cream - overall its really rich and sweet. Earthy peat with some ashiness and some savory salinity. 

**Finish:** Medium to long. Sweet pear - almost some calvados notes. Rich and sweet creaminess with vanilla and sugar. Woody ashy peat sneaks in with lots of nice minerality as well. 

**Overall:** This dram is scotch. This dram is loaded with sweet buttercream, with lots of ashy and faintly peppery peat. This dram seems like a pretty standard Compass Box peat profile to me but it could easily be Springbank/Longrow as well. Overall, its not super vegetal which rules out ye olde Laphroaig. My notes say it is: "v good, v complex" since I guess Im speaking like the hip kids again. I really liked this a lot. 

Thanks for reading!
