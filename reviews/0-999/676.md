[**Review #676 | Bourbon Review #389 - Four Roses OESK Private Selection Mollys Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-676-four-roses-private-selection-oesk-mollys-selection/)

**The Schtick:** Four Roses releases single barrels of a specific recipe at cask strength as their private pick program. This is one of the best values in cask strength bourbon that heralds quality and availability, in my personal opinion.

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses   

**Bottler:** Four Roses 

**Selection:** Mollys

**ABV:**  56% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet vanilla, caramel, some pepper and faint fruitiness. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, bot of heat. Sweet caramel. Honey, floral fruitiness, oaky with some nice pepper.

**Finish:** Medium length, growing bitter. 

**Overall:** This was interesting - its the first 4R I really found bitter and thats saying a lot given my love of the OESK recipe. That said, this is the first time Ive noticed it in 4R, so Im not alarmed. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
