[**Review #835 | Rye Review #449 - Winchester Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-835-winchester-rye/)

**The Schtick:** This is a Total Wine house brand that is sourced from TerrePURE in the Carolinas - a company that "hyper ages" distills products by attempting to age them faster than conventionally possible using a proprietary method. They claim that this process will revolutionize the industry by providing producers with products that are comparable to well aged bourbons and ryes, in just a fraction of that time. Lets see how it is.
