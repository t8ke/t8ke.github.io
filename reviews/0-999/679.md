**The Schtick:** This comes from a 4-way blind send courtesy of /u/playingwithfire. He said hes sent me 4 samples (Crown Hand Select, Crown Apple, Mystery, Mystery Rum - all blind), most of them garbage, and let me go from there. I took notes and here they are. I did the tasting and got the reveals on the Whiskey Network Discord Server and then wrote up the pertinent details for posting the review. Enjoy!

**Distiller:** Forty Creek

**Bottler:** Forty Creek

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**   Sweet maple, honey, vanilla, mocha. Overall, sweet but muted. 

**Taste:** Light mouthfeel, no heat. Faint sugar. Not as sweet as the Apple. Definitely sweet though. Salted caramel, cocoa, mocha. Really strange. 

**Finish:** Short, lots of cocoa, maple, salted caramel, toffee and vanilla. Sweet finish. 

**Overall:** I dont really know what this is. I think it could be Crown Salted Caramel, but this isnt as cloying or sweet as the Apple, so that leads me to think not. Guessing its a whiskey with some added sweetness. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
