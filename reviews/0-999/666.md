**Distiller:** Glen Grant

**Bottler:** Gordon MacPhail

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 56.7% ABV

**Nose:**  Sticky butterscotch, plums. Rich syrupy sherry, nutty toffee. Overall very rich. More toffee forward sherry presence with light floral fruity noes and dole fruit syrup type makeup. Really really enticing nose. 

**Taste:** Thick mouth feel, really restrained heat. Sweet butterscotch, nutty sherry paired with figs, dates, bananas and some jammy raspberry. Tobacco, nougat and some nice pepper balances nicely. 

**Finish:** Long, stewed fruits steal the show with a nice toffee bomb exit. 

**Overall:** Why dont I drink more Glen Grant? Hoo baby, I really enjoyed this. A lot. 

Thanks for reading!
