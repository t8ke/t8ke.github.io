[**Review #70 | Bourbon Review #40 - Stagg Jr. Batch 4**]( https://t8ke.review/review-70-stagg-jr-batch-4/)

**The Schtick:** Stagg Jr is made from the same mashbill as the Buffalo Trace Antique Collections George T. Stagg product. This is aged "almost ten years" per the label and is bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 64.35% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Very muted overall. Some clove, vanilla and spice. 

**Taste:** Oh thank god. Theres vanilla, lots of cherry and chocolate and a bit of molasses and cream. Its hot, but not punishing. Its proportional and very well blended with the other notes. 

**Finish:** Its long, its a bit hot but this has the most flavor of any batch so far. I like it. 

**Overall:** Progress has been made - this is the first of the batches that has left me feeling a bit impressed. The nose, palate and finish are all very solid and align closely with what I hoped Id find. Big flavor, present but not punishing ethanol notes and a great finish. 

Thanks for reading!
