[**Review #142 | Bourbon Review #79 - Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (Batch 8)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-142-elijah-craig-barrel-proof-batch-8/)

**The Schtick:** This is a moderately elusive release from Elijah Craig, which is Heaven Hill distillate bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 69.9% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Cherry is back but not like in the early batches. Still very rich though and loaded with molasses, maple sweetness, vanilla and a hint of cola. 

**Taste:** Good balance of proof and taste. Thick and rich but not too numbing compared to some of the earlier batches. Lots of maple here and a good bit of oaky spice. 

**Finish:** Not quite as long as 7, but still very satisfying. Hot and sweet, very well balanced here more so than the palate. 

**Overall:** This one started to really exhibit a bit of change - but not a ton. Im noticing just how consistent these batches are. Unlike Stagg Jr and more like Bookers, theres tiny variation but overall the notes are very pronounced and well defined without any major outliers. Delicious and solid.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
