[**Review #725 | Scotch Review #246 - Ardbeg Grooves Committee Release**]( https://t8ke.review/review-725-redbreast-lustau/)

**The Schtick:** This is the high proof expression of Ardbegs 2018 limited edition release, Grooves. It features maturation in aggressively recharred red wine casks.  I sampled it live in the Whiskey Network Discord and got the reveal in real time there as well. 

-----

**Distiller:** Ardbeg

**Bottler:** Ardbeg

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 51.6% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, tobacco, cream, strong, earthy peat. Melon, passion fruit, lime, minerality. Mossy, maritime air, oddly doughy.

**Taste:** Rich, no heat. Sulfur, ashy peat, lime, heavy minerality. Vanilla butter cream. Wet peat slap, some toffee. Not a ton of sherry or wine influence, if there is any. Pepper with some tobacco and a nice sweetness. 

**Finish:** Long, some growing heat, sweet tiramisu. Bready, sweet, nice vanilla undertones and long growing ashy peatiness.

**Overall:** Im guessing this is Ardbeg or Ledaig based on the earthy, minerality. There is some fruit influence so Im guessing tired sherry casks or refill sherry, maybe red wine but not certain.. This is 8-11 years old, ABV between 48 and 52%. Not sure if OB or IB but it seems like either could be likely. Definitely scotch, definitely peated. Not super heavily peated, but well peated. Guessing Ardbeg before Ledaig although both are possible.

Thanks for reading!
