[**Review #57 | Bourbon Review #30 - Bookers Maw Maws Batch (2015-05)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-57-bookers-2015-05-maw-maws-batch/)

**The Schtick:** Bookers is a Beam/Suntory product that is released unfiltered and at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  64% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Lots of sugar and vanilla. Not so much ethanol. More pepper and leather. 

**Taste:** More cinnamon and still loads of maple and vanilla. Caramel, ethanol, vanilla. Its all there.   

**Finish:** Lots longer but lots more alcohol burn it seems as opposed to #1. Still not too much burn to turn me away though. I wondered how much true batch variation there could be in all of these and while its not massively variant, there is some.

**Overall:** If theres one thing to know about Bookers, its the generally impressive consistency. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
