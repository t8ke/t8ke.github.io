**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Smooth Ambler

**Selection:** Annapolis Whiskey Society

**ABV:** 58.7% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Maple sugar, molasses, black pepper, vanilla cream, mild clove

**Taste:**   Sweet and dessert-like. Clove heavy, medium mouth feel but with an odd, woody, astringent set of notes stomping in. Seems a tad hot, but nothing too insane and very generous and gentle for the actual proof

**Finish:** Medium, sweet with more of that odd wood funk. A little less astringent here.

**Overall:**  This is far from a bad dram, but Im going to set forth the likely unpopular opinion that this isnt amazing. The more I try these bourbons from Smooth Ambler, the more I realize that MGP bourbon just isnt my jam like their rye is. I like this a lot more than a lot of 10yr SiB products so I dont doubt this was well picked but overall I just dont think the base spirit is for me. Im rating this dram a 6 - its good but nothing exceptional. Overall, I think I set my internal expectations far too high but thats just how the donut rolls sometimes. Thanks for reading!

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
