[**Review #717 | Bourbon Review #404 - Charbay R5 Hop Flavored Whiskey**]( https://t8ke.review/review-717-charbay-r5-hop-flavored-whiskey/)

**The Schtick:** This is a whiskey being made from hopped beer, coming from Charbay in California. 

-----

**Distiller:** Charbay

**Bottler:** Charbay

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 49.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Wet, sticky, caramel. Bready, hoppy, pepper, banana bread, hempy. Sweet, funky, malty, hoppy. Entirely unique.

**Taste:** Medium, oak, caramel, funky sweetness. Hemp, toffee, caramel canides, IPA/beer notes, some heat.

**Finish:** Medium length, funky and young, weird weed presence. Hops, toffee, coffee, sticky cinnamon roll.

**Overall:** This was a wild roller coaster of funky flavors. I enjoyed it, but having Charbays BC pick, and hoping this was close, it wasnt close at all. Its obvious that this is younger, different and the lack of proof also makes a significant difference. That said, it wasnt actively flawed, but between this and Buffalo Trace, I know what Id reach for on the daily.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
