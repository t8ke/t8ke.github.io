**The Schtick:** This was sent to me as a blind sample. I reviewed it live on the official Whiskey Network Discord server and got the reveal so that I could type up this review. 

-----

**Distiller:** Linkwood

**Bottler:** The Exclusive Malts

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 46.3% ABV

**Age:** 18 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sticky and sweet. Cocoa, syrup, maple, molasses. Nutty toffee, fruits, sherry. Tobacco, stewed fruits, some mild funk. This is absolutely cloyingly sweet on the nose.  

**Taste:** Really sweet. Almost unnaturally so. Sugar, fruits, caramel, cocoa, some mild heat, medium mouthfeel. Maybe some port influence. 

**Finish:** Short, fruity and sweet. Did I mention it is sweet? Cola, cocoa, leather, toffee, pepper, still really suspiciously sweet. 

**Overall:** 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
