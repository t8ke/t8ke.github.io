**The Schtick:** This is a one time, limited edition release in the Boss Hog series from WhistlePig in Vermont. Typically, they source Alberta rye, but have also sourced MGP from time to time. This is one of those times. Its 14 years old, bottled at cask strength and finished in Armagnac casks. It sells, at MSRP, for an eye watering $500. I have a feeling this is either WPs attempt to give it status, or beat out the secondary Willett style. Either way, though, whats it taste like?  Thats what were here to figure out. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Whistle Pig

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  62% ABV

**Age:** 14 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Oak, stewed fruits, peppery. Dry, earthy, mild dill. Brown sugar and cloves.  

**Taste:** Thick and rich. Hot. Theres a lot of heat here. Dry, oaky, earthy and tannic. Theres a little nip of stewed fruits along with bitter, musty pepper. Some good armagnac character is here, but its overpowered by the oak. I notice very little MGP spice/dill here. 

**Finish:** Medium length, more heat and some bitter earthiness. 

**Overall:** This bottle is not for me. I tried this over two tasting sessions and the first time I really hated it. The second time, I gave it about a half an hour (compared to my usual 20min) of airtime and that seemed to really make some improvements. Overall, though, I think its too bitter and oak driven, the MGP character and armagnac character are almost completely buried. Pricing aside, Id honestly pass on this in the stead of almost any other reasonable CS rye on the market. 

Thanks for reading!
