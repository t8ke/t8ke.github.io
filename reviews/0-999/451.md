**The Schtick:** Im really not sure theres enough buzzwords in that title. Anyways. This is a limited edition, proofed up, single barrel release from Compass Box that takes the GKS base blend anad further ages it for a year or so in a barrel of their choosing. This bottle comes from Binnys (their pick) and is finished for a year in their ex-Highland malt whiskey blend.

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Compass Box

**Selection:** Binnys

**ABV:**  49% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet apples, pears, almonds. Theres allspice, vanilla, figs and light sweet fruitiness throughout. Rich vanilla buttercream and faint sherried notes. Its like dessert in a dram, but also light, fruity and effervescent. 

**Taste:** Thin mouthfeel, but no heat at all either. Rich bouquet of fruits, apples, vanilla, pears and almonds. Theres some cream, caramel, nice nuttiness. There is also some nice fig and a hint of sulfur. 

**Finish:** Long and complex. Mild in terms of heat, fruity and sweet. Really tastes like dessert but not cloying. 

**Overall:** Im really a fan of this and I like the direction it takes. It was mildly astringent and hot near the top, but by the 75% mark I really feel it hit its stride and just kept on marching. The heat went away and all of the really rich cream and fruitiness shone. Delicious and very unique - it was a fun experiment to try. It was also nice to see the elevated proof which I feel contributed a good bit. 

Thanks for reading!
