**Nose:**  Musty. Bouquet of apples - like standing in the orchard. Sweet cream. Almost some root beer here. Lots of vanilla. Deep toffee. Caramel. No real acetone here.

**Taste:** Pretty rich mouthfeel, but some oaky tannins setting in. Drying. Caramel. Oak. Vanilla and a whallop of clove. Theres some interesting funkiness that is hard to explain but it can be best described as musty. Its good, though.

**Finish:** Long, a bit hot, but long and oaky. Sweeter than the others, though, which I really like. This is aligning a bit better to balance the spicy oaky nature of the other samples Ive not been as satisfied with before.

**Overall:** This is really quite different, and I enjoy it. I still dont think Ive hit the holy grail of turkey as this was definitely better than previous WTKS but I didnt shit my pants from glory. That being said, I really liked it. Its easily the best WTKS that Ive had so far. I liked the more complex notes that were in force which makes this an easy Rank 7 for me. Its good. Its Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit Pewter Top release.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
