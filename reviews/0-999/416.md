**The Schtick:** This WhistlePig is sourced Alberta rye that is bottled from a single barrel and at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Alberta

**Bottler:** Whistle Pig

**Selection:** NH State

**ABV:** 60.2% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Big clove, definitely Alberta, wintergreen. Cinnamon, brown sugar, fruitiness.

**Taste:** Thick and rich. Some heat. Sweet wintergreen, brown sugar, cinnamon, fruity Alberta notes. Some molasses and astringency. Huge and abrasively rich rye.  

**Finish:** Long, some heat. Sweet, some anise and a lot of minty notes here. Not MGP dill mint notes - more wintergreen minty. Its just mint all over the place coupled with anise.  

**Overall:** Huge, delicious, rich. I really like it although the minty notes are very heavy handed here. If that was more balanced with the brown sugar and rye spice this would have scored higher. I definitely liked the KL barrel I had earlier in the year but this is no slouch either. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
