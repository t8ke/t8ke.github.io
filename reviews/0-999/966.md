**The Schtick:** Makers Mark, one of the larger producers of bourbon in Kentucky, produces wheated bourbon that is sold both domestically and abroad. Until recent years, Makers only produced a small handful of products. In the last couple of years, though, products like Makers Mark 46 and Makers Mark Cask Strength have seen domestic releases. A major criticism of the brand, though, was the absence of a barrel selection program in favor of wax dipped limited editions. That has now changed. A barrel selection at Makers Mark is unique, though, in that you choose a combination of staves to mature in a barrel, and that barrel is bottled. This is different from almost any other barrel selection process on the market. For better or for worse, this creates a very different product than their core line of expressions. Ive set out to try approximately a dozen of these various private selections, completely blind, to gather my thoughts on how their releases are shaking out.

**Distiller:** Makers Mark

**Bottler:** Makers Mark

**Selection:** Total Wine

**ABV:** 55.7% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Lots of clove, graham cracker. Almost nutty. Vanilla, cocoa, confectioners sugar, light plum. Generally sweet, and spicy with a hint of fruit. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Oaky cocoa, lots of pepper and clove. Its pretty hot here, too. A nice tobacco presence, though.

**Finish:** Short to medium length, dry oaky and hot. 

**Overall:** Generally, I thought this started in a great place, and slowly slid into a less great one. Its a bit too hot, dry and over oaked for my palate.  

Thanks for reading!
