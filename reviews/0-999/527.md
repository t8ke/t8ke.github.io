**The Schtick:** I was given a bottle of this in a trade a while back. Really green around the ears so far with cognac. Lets see how it goes. 

-----

**Distiller:** Courvoisier

**Bottler:** Courvoisier

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Vibrant, floral, syrupy sweets. Raisins, caramel, froot by the foot. Super jammy, borderling cloying.  

**Taste:** Thin but sweet, stewed fruits. No heat. Plums, pears, figs, caramel and cocoa are pretty prominent here. 

**Finish:** Short, no heat. Sweet and stuff rolling with that Fruit by the Foot vibe. 

**Overall:** This isnt terrible. Sure, its not great, but I enjoyed it for what it was. I bet it would make a pretty great cocktail. Neat, its a little sweet and a hair thin. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
