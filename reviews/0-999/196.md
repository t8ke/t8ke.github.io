**The Schtick:** This series is an interesting experiment at the hands of tomatin to get you to buy not one, not two, not three but four different bottlings that have been finished in different casks. This is #4 since I passed on Fino, Oloroso and Manzanilla. I wanted to try them all but the other three were out of stock and I was only in the market to buy one so I got this one. Thanks, Universe.

**Distiller:** Tomatin

**Bottler:** Tomatin

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  thin sherry and vanilla. plums, grapes and raspberries are most notable. In my notes I have written: "watered down macallan" and I think thats just the best way to say it. It smells like 60% macallan 12 and 30% water.

**Taste:** Thin but sweet. Grapes and some nice mild spice. Astringent and mildly hot with an interesting faint turn towards burning rubber and plastic. Im not sure how much I love that note in what I was expecting to be a nice sweet sherried dram.

**Finish:** Short but sweet and fruity. a little hot, with lots of figs, sugar and light charcoal and cream. Those damn tires are back, albeit faintly.

**Overall:** Im glad in the end I didnt buy all four. I saved myself about $180 and some tears, I think. Theres multiple flaws here but the two biggest being the watered down feel and the weird rubber notes in the palate and finish. For this reasons, Im giving Tomatin Cuatro 4 12yr PX a 4. Its not awful but its overpriced for what it is and there are some flaws. Here at rank 4, it sits among other decent but flawed drams such as Benromach 10 and Nikka Coffey Grain. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
