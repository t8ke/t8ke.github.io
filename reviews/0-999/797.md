-----

**Distiller:** Benrinnes

**Bottler:** Douglas Laings Old Particular

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:** 57.4% ABV

**Nose:**  Floral, bread-y, yeasty and peppery. Stone fruits, meaty, earthy. Overall, its pretty a pretty spicy, yeast-y nose. No peat or smoke. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, some heat. Bread-y, lots of pepper here. Jammy and sweet with a nice caramel presence. Tobacco, sulfur. 

**Finish:** Long, and rich. Lots of pepper. Super juicy, almost in the same vein as an Oregon Pinot Noir. Meaty, lots of body. Rich cocoa, earthy pepper.
