[**Review #426 | Scotch Review #426 - The Sovereign 51yo Grain**]( https://t8ke.review/review-426-sovereign51grain/)

**The Schtick:** This is the grain whiskey version of the recent 51yo Sovereign malt review I did that is bottled by K&amp;L.

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Sovereign 

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:** 44.6% ABV

**Age:** 51 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet cream, vanilla, cake, caramel. This smells like all sweet, almost like creme brulee. 

**Taste:** Really nice, no heat. Rich, oily. Sweet caramel, lots of vanilla and loads of toffee. This is like dessert in a dram, rich, sweet and satisfying without becoming cloying. I would call this a literal caramel bomb. Butterscotch is just dripping everywhere here. Delicious. Slight drying oak which helps balance perfectly. 

**Finish:** Medium in length, filled with sweet dessert notes. Complex creme brulee, caramel, toffee, butterscotch are here in force.

**Overall:** Usually grain whiskeys get a bad wrap but this is phenomenal. It caters to my love of dessert by providing what is probably the largest butterscotch bomb Ive had before. Balancing this with some subtle oak provides a lot of complexity here. I love it.  

Thanks for reading!
