**The Schtick:** THis is a new, Limited Edition release of cask strength rye from New Richmond distillery. This is supposedly a very small release of their 55 month old rye from barrel #74, bottled at cask strength.

-----

**Distiller:** New Richmond

**Bottler:** New Richmond

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 60.115% ABV

**Age:** 4 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Molasses, grassy and floral. Honey and clove. Faint, wet, straw.

**Taste:** Wet straw, a bit hot, molasses, clove, peppercorns, allspice and toffee.

**Finish:** Long, growing heat, rye and clove spice, honey, toffee and nice floral notes.

**Overall:** This is a good showing from them, although there are still signs its a bit young. Promising, and Im looking forward to their older releases when they come around.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
