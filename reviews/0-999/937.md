[**Review #937 | Gin Review #8 - Great Lakes Distillery Orchard Gin Series: Pear**]( https://t8ke.review/review-937-great-lakes-distillery-orchard-series-gin-pear/)

**The Schtick:** This is a gin that is produced using a fruit base by Great Lakes Distillery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In this case, the base fruit is pear. There are a variety of other Orchard Series releases on the market now, and I look forward to buying and trying those also.

**Nose:**  Vibrantly fruity, lots of pear, vanilla, light spices. Some coriander. Also very musty.  

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel but no heat. Lots of musty fruit here, bread-y almost. Pear, lime, fresh baked bread, light vanilla influence. Not a ton here besides must and fruit. 

**Finish:** Short, mildly astringent, fruity and sweet. Off in an instant. 

**Overall:** This was a really interesting release, but Im not sure it jived with me neat. Or as the sole liquor in a cocktail. I did find, though, that with a healthy amount of lime juice, some cranberry liqueur, a little Plymouth gin and seltzer, the must was toned down and it made for an enjoyable synthesis. It worked in a lot of things, but overcoming that musty pear note was a tad difficult. I look forward to seeing if this is less of an issue in the other releases, though. 

Thanks for reading!
