[**Review #93 | Bourbon Review #53 - Heaven Hill 6yr Bottled in Bond**]( https://t8ke.review/review-93-heaven-hill-bottled-in-bond-6yr/)

**The Schtick:** This is an age stated, bottled in bond, value bourbon from Heaven Hill. 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Really sweet, lots of caramel, corn, vanilla, grain and some healthy syrupy sweetness.

**Taste:** The sweetness continues. Kind of thin mouthfeel but the sweet cream, vanilla and syrupy sugar balance it out.

**Finish:** Short but still oddly complex. While its short, its not harsh or young feeling. The vanilla and caramel are there and its delicious.

**Overall:** This is a great value and a great contender in the Bottled in Bond category. It has good age and the palate reflects that. Very well done.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
