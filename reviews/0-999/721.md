[**Review #721 | Bourbon Review #406 - Elijah Craig Discount Liquor Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-721-elijah-craig-small-batch-discount-liquors-selection/)

**The Schtick:** This is a local selection of a NAS Elijah Craig pick. It is distilled at Heaven Hill and bottled under the EC label. 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill  

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** Discount Liquors

**ABV:**  47% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, vanilla, caramel, faint oak. Sweet, buttered corn. Faint allspice. 

**Taste:** Medium. No heat. Rich cocoa, honey, vanilla, toffee and some nice oak presence, without being too overbearing. Nice melon fruitiness, some confectioners sugar and icing. Faint tobacco. 

**Finish:** Medium length, mild heat, sweet cream and rich toffee. Sweet buttered popcorn. 

**Overall:** I couldnt be happier that they dropped the 12yr age statement. This is definitely younger, and far better than the older, dry and overoaked releases Ive had before this. This is nice and complex, with good depth and balance.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
