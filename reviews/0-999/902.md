[**Review #902 | Bourbon Review #472 - William Heavenhill Bottled in Bond**]( https://t8ke.review/review-902-william-heavenhill-bottled-in-bond/)

**The Schtick:** This is a limited edition, Heaven Hill gift shop only bottle. This release is bottled in bond.

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Corn, oak, pepper, honey. Very stereotypical bourbon. its a very bourbon-y bourbon. Lots of corn sweetness, with some oak and pepper to round it out. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Honey, light fruitiness. Oak, pepper, tobacco. Some cinnamon, some caramel. No real heat, very mild for the proof. 

**Finish:** Short to medium, mild heat. Oak, pepper, vanilla, some caramel and pepper.

**Overall:** There is nothing wrong with this bottle. There is nothing insanely phenomenal about it, either. I sort of think of it as a quintessential bourbon, it has all of the standard flavors but doesnt fall short or taste young, either. Is it worth the mammoth price tag? Well, thats up to you to decide. I know that I enjoyed every dram of this, but no more than a good Eagle Rare 10, or some Buffalo Trace selections. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
