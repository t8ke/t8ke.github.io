[**Review #501 | World Review #11 - 1961 Seagrams Crown Royal Blended Whiskey**]( https://t8ke.review/review-501-1961-crown-royal/)

**The Schtick:** This is a pretty old bottle of Crown Royal blended whiskey. 

-----

**Distiller:** Seagrams

**Bottler:** Seagrams/Crown Royal

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Very sticky sweet. Caramel, honey, melon, brown sugar. Almost like smelling cinnabon in the mall. 

**Taste:** Thin but no heat. Sweet and rich caramel. Some faint melon. Clove, maple syrup and brown sugar. 

**Finish:** Medium, like syrupy molasses.

**Overall:** This is really interesting - its super sweet as far as most whiskeys go but still very reminiscent of modern Crown. I like this much better, but the resemblance is there. At the end of the day, this isnt a fantastic bottle, but it was really fun to drink through and share some with friends and acquaintances to see their reactions also. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
