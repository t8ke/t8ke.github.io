[**Review #413 | Scotch Review #163 - Compass Box Spice Tree Extravaganza**]( https://t8ke.review/review-413-compass-box-spice-tree-extravaganza/)

**The Schtick:** This is a revamped product that uses the same concept as OG Spice Tree, but uses significantly older components and also integrates more sherry cask whiskey into the mix. You can download a sexy fact sheet here 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Compass Box

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Intensely aromatic. Big fruit notes like apple, pear, some faint melon. Sweet vanilla, honey, maybe a faint hint of raspberry and jammy cherry. Its very "bright" and effervescent.

**Taste:**  Nice mouthfeel, proof is well behaved but still high enough to give this a nice, oily mouthfeel. Sweet apples, pears, raspberry. Faint cocoa, vanilla is huge. Theres a hint of caramel but this is very fruit forward. Im surprised there isnt any Clynelish in here because its almost waxy fruit. Faint astringency, but much more balanced and complex than regular Spice Tree. 

**Finish:** Medium in length but surprisingly hot. This is kind of surprising. Some sulfur here too. Its nice and fruity still but less pleasant than the palate.  

**Overall:** This was going great places until the finish struck. It wasnt awful or really devastating but I thought this might reach higher than the 6 Im going to give it. The nose and palate were delightful but with it leaving the taste behind that it does, I wouldnt group it with other whiskeys that have scored into the 7 category. 

Thanks for reading!
