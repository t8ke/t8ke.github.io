[**Review #29 | Scotch Review #8 - The Balvenie 15yr Sherry Fill**]( https://t8ke.review/review-29-the-balvenie-15yr-single-barrel-sherry-cask/)

**The Schtick:** This is a sherry matured 15yr expression from The Balvenie.  

-----

**Distiller:** Balvenie

**Bottler:** Balvenie

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 47.8% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Loads of raisins, plums, all manner of dark, stewed fruits. Theres brown sugar and that notorious sherry spice and then more fruit once again. A little maple spice in the tail end.

**Taste:** Theres spice, theres sugar. The dark fruit is here and it whallops you over the head. Theres some very mild tobacco, maybe Im confusing this for some light oak and leather notes but I like it. Its well introduced under the monster sherry wave and finished out with some light maple sweetness.         

**Finish:** Its not as long as Id expect but its well blended and delicately tip toes away. Theres a bit more spice in the finish, much like the other two but I like this arrangement. Its very gentle, which is likely a function of the lower proof but it fits the bill for a solid sherry bomb, which has quickly become my favorite style of scotch releases.      

**Overall:** Its delicious. Its a little pricey. What it does (sherry) it does very well with restraint and some nice balance. 

Thanks for reading!
