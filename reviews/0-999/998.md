**The Schtick:** This is a release from Bunnahabhain that is heavily peated 2008 distillate that is matured in Bordeaux wine casks. It is bottled at cask strength with no coloring or filtering. 

-----

**Distiller:** Bunnahabhain

**Bottler:** Bunnahabhain

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 58.1% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Pungent right out of the gate. Vegetal, moist, damp mossy earthy peat. Huge and overpowering. Light vanilla. Light stewed fruits. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Peat steps back here. Plums, figs and rich honey abound. Lightly nutty, faint cocoa. Lots of pepper, light tobacco, more minerality and then a big punch of minerality and ashy smoke. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and sweet. Smoke takes back over, crushing that palate sweetness and delivering a long, ashy, woody, vegetal peat slap. Faint minerality. Some soap stone. 

**Overall:** This is nice, but really disjointed in my opinion. Its good, but I was hoping for a lot more complexity in the typical war between peat and wine. The nose was ok, the palate was phenomenal and the finish wasnt half bad. That puts me in a weird spot. Over the course of a bottle, though, I noticed the palate grew more vibrant, so lets give this the benefit of the doubt. Id buy another. 

Thanks for reading!
