[**Review #414 | Bourbon Review #236 - Eagle Rare 10 Nashville Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-414-eagle-rare-10yr-nashville-pick/)

**The Schtick:** Buffalo Trace. Mashbill 1. 10yrs Aging. 45% ABV. Generally plentiful and inexpensive. What is not to love?

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Cocoa. Bananas. Passion Fruit. Weirdly like bananas foster mixed with vanilla, caramel, cocoa. Delicious smelling. 

**Taste:**  Thicker than usual mouthfeel but hella unique. Bit hot. Lots of big oaky tannins, vanilla and caramel are really prominent here. I notice the heat here more but the flavor is also really jacked up. Big passion fruit mixed with Werthers caramels. Much richer. Mmmm

**Finish:**  Medium and oaky, dry. Sweet fruits are here when the dryness fades. 

**Overall:**  Well, balls. This is a really unique pick and it strays from the "typical" ER10 profile Ive picked up on over time (and many bottles). I understand that ER10 is still pretty much a single barrel product but this might be the most unique pick that Ive had. I really like the bigger, brasher flavors and the mouth feel is pretty improved over the usual. Not to say the usual is bad, by any stretch, but this is something else. Big fan here. 

Thanks for reading!
