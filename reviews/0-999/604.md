**The Schtick:** This is a whiskey produced from 100% Ohio red winter wheat, finished for 18 months in Oloroso sherry barrels. It is bottled at 51% ABV. This was sent to me as a blind review, and I have gotten the reveal from the sender in order to fill in the pertinent info here for posting.

**Distiller:** Middle West Spirits

**Bottler:** Middle West Spirits

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  51% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**   Corn, cassia, almost a juniper characteristic, but its more new make-y than juniper. Floral. Theres a lot of sherry, syrupy sweet and lots of tobacco.

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel. Some mild heat, but not too bad. Syrupy sweetness, lots of cocoa. New make is there though, which gives up the age a bit. Im guessing its pretty young. Lots of corn. Syrupy sweet fruits though, stewed raspberries. Blends nicely. 

**Finish:** Medium, some heat but not a lot. Really complex - new make, corn, green bark notes. Lots of syrupy fruits. Tobacco, pepper.

**Overall:** Young ass American Whiskey finished in PX or Oloroso. The corn and new make notes are too dominant to make me think Scotch. The wine is unmistakable and a bit overbearing. Overall, though, its not half bad - and very interesting. Guessing proof between 43 and 48% ABV.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
