[**Review #37 | Scotch Review #15 - Lagavulin 16**]( https://t8ke.review/review-37-lagavulin-16/)

**The Schtick:** This is an older, but lower proofed version of Lagavulin 12. Now the pride and jewel of Parks and Rec and Ron Swanson alike, it has reached some level of cult popularity despite the merits of what is in the bottle. 

-----

**Distiller:** Lagavulin

**Bottler:** Lagavulin

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 16 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweetness and smoke, both together and a bit less peat. Its there, but not overpowering and certainly more subtle than the 12. Light vanilla and some mild citrus.

**Taste:** This is definitely a much lighter dram than the 12, this is likely attributed to the 12% drop in ABV. A little more blended with no particular flavor dominating under the smokey canopy. I like that I experience a bit more fruit and sweetness here, especially brown sugar and cream. That being said, it really feels "weak". I think Id rather take the improvements garnered from the boost in proof than the additional sweetness here. Im not as impressed as with the 12. 

**Finish:** Surprisingly the finish doesnt seem as long as the 12, but its also less harsh. The smoke lingers a bit more but theres less richness and complexity here. 

**Overall:** This bottle is fine. Its really just fine. I understand why some people are annoyed with it - its every fanboys favorite and Ill even admit I have a bottle and box signed by the Duke himself. That being said, you can find better quality product in the same product line and in many others - often for a more reasonable price, also. 

Thanks for reading!
