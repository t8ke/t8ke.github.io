[**Review #943 | Scotch Review #313 - Bunnahabhain 12yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-943-bunnahabhain-12-year/)

**The Schtick:** This is a core range release from Bunnahabhain. It is aged for 12 years by Bunna on Islay. About 20% of Bunnas distillate is heavily peated, but this is an unpeated release from them. It contains 25% sherried malt and 75% malt aged in ex-bourbon. I reviewed this some years ago and thought it fitting for a revisit.

**Distiller:** Bunnahabhain

**Bottler:** Bunnahabhain

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet honey, fresh baked bread. Nice light oak, some pepper, a bit of sherry sweetness. Very faint pepper, tiniest whiff of smoke. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No real heat. Sweet honey, tobacco, bread-y. Sweet fruits, sherry presence is mild but present. Light tobacco and very faint salinity and ash. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length, lots of currant, caramel, light bread characteristics and some pepper.

**Overall:** Overall, one of my favorite core line products in the space of 12yr single malts around the $55 mark. Its sweet, and well rounded but interesting enough to enjoy an entire bottle of. A tiny bit of Bunnahabhains Islay character shines through, which blends well with the sweetness of the sherry and base spirit here with the ex-bourbon which makes for a really enjoyable experience. 

Thanks for reading!
