**The Schtick:** This is a dusty, early 90s bottling of The Macallans classic 12yr "Matured in Sherry Wood" single malt offering. Im a fan of the current Mac 12 but I dont love that the price is rising and the quality is decreasing according to many. How is Macallan of old? Lets find out.

-----

**Distiller:** Macallan

**Bottler:** Macallan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet pound cake, raisins, fig, plum, cocoa, honey

**Taste:** Pretty good for the proof. Mild sulfur, but overall very sweet and sherry forward. Lots of cocoa, plums, figs, sherry sweetness, etc. I wish I had the current bottling to SBS but if I had to take a stab, this is a bit better than the current day bottling, which I enjoy, but not worlds apart. What I notice here is a slightly richer mouthfeel and more prominent cocoa sherry notes.

**Finish:** Medium, no heat. Sweet with sherry richness and mild cocoa and caramel.

**Overall:** This is very good but Im hesitant to go bonkers over it. Id still probably only pay $50 or $55 for this if I could buy it on the shelf. It is, in my opinion, better than the current product provided by Macallan but its not worlds apart or insanely improved. I"m going to save an ounce of this to SBS with modern Macallan. Im going to give this a Rank 6 - its good but lets not get dusty fever, here, pals.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
