**The Schtick:** This is a 20 year old release by Douglas Laings Old Particular IB line made up of 20yr spirit from the Arran distillery. It was matured in a refill hogshead and is bottled into one of 136 releases bottles. 

-----

**Distiller:** Arran

**Bottler:** Douglas Laings Old Particular

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 44.4% ABV

**Age:** 20 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, toffee, rich stewed fruits. Lots of sweet caramel, some currant and then blackberry. Jam. Nice and nutty, almost an amaretto note. Lightly grassy. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, but no heat. Honey, light sulfur, cherry cordial, blackberry jam. Tobacco, pepper, and nice tart orange peel. 

**Finish:** Long, dry, funky. Orange peel, lemon zest, cherry and lots of tobacco and sulfur. A bit more sulfur than I enjoy, and also this borderline bandage funk. Not like peat, but very mild funk. Strange, but pairs well.

**Overall:** This is funky and strange, swinging from one side of a standard sherried profile to another. I enjoyed it, though, and wish I had the cajones to snap up a bottle when they were on sale. 

Thanks for reading!
