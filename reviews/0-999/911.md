**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottler release of Ardbeg spirit that is managed by The Boutique-y Whisky Company. It is bottled without any coloring or filtering and also at cask strength. Although their releases are admittedly on the more expensive end of the whiskey IB market, especially for 500ml bottles, their artwork is well known and popular in the space.

**Distiller:** Ardbeg

**Bottler:** The Boutique-y Whisky Company

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  52% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich cream, lemon lime zest. Sweet honey, ashy smoke. Faintly vegetal. Light lactic character, but mostly just ashy and loaded with lemon lime dessert notes.   

**Taste:** Thick, rich, sweet. Very little heat, well behaved. Honey, lemon meringue, lime soda. Pepper, some tobacco. Really nice and sweet, with some caramel making an entrance at the end. The peat is there but subdued compared to some more fiery Ardbeg drams. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and sweet. Loads of ashy, wood burning smoke. This combined with rich vanilla butter cream and a nice citrus tart dessert cake note makes this a really memorable finish. 

**Overall:** Really nice showing from Boutique-y. I enjoyed this quite a bit, and particularly found myself fond of the tuned back peat to let some other, more hidden, notes shine. 

Thanks for reading!
