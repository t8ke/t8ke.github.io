**Distiller:** Bertrand

**Bottler:** Uberach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Plums, malt, sticky toffee and dessert pudding. Cocoa, honey, creme brulee. Really malt forward. Faintly musty.  

**Taste:** Sweet, but thin mouthfeel. Some faint heat. Lactic, sour fruits, honey and plums. Some grape influence and with time in the glass, there is almost a mild smoke presence. Some faint pepper. 

**Finish:** Medium length with some heat and a musty fruity profile. 

**Overall:** Rich but almost too meaty / musty / malty. I think this could use a little more barrel time to balance out those notes. Not bad, but could use a little work. Interesting, all the same, though. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
