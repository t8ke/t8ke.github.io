[**Review #733 | World Review #24 - Crown Royal Bourbon Mash Canadian Whisky**]( https://t8ke.review/review-733-crown-royal-blenders-series-bourbon-mash/)

**The Schtick:** This is a release from Crown Royal up in the great, white north (talking weather, not demographics) and this release features a "bourbon mash bill". Its still made up in Canada, and is a NAS release, though, so the mash is about where the similarities to bourbon end. Lets see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** Crown Royal

**Bottler:** Crown Royal

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Young grain, young corn. Wet cardboard. Some caramel and confectioners sugar. Mostly wet, damp, musty, new make-y.

**Taste:** Thin, young. No real heat. "Green". Wet cardboard, youthful grain notes, musty. Some faint sweetness. Mostly musty. 

**Finish:** Short, no real heat here either. Its over in a flash, and without much positive characteristic. 

**Overall:** This tastes like a young craft product. I didnt really expect it to be mind blowing, but I find regular Crown ok and inoffensive. This, on the other hand, is bad whiskey. The presentation is nice, but everything that matters (what is in the bottle) is a pass, any day. 

Thanks for reading!
