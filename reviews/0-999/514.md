**The Schtick:** This is a 10 year old single barrel from Belle Meade. It was a pick done through Craft Brewed. Belle Meade is bourbon sourced from MGP by the Green Brier distillery in Nashville, TN. This is bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Green Brier

**Selection:** Craft Brewed

**ABV:** 51.4% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Definitely MGP - brown sugar, maple and tobacco. Theres some faint cracked pepper and a nice cocoa note also.  

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, very little heat though. Sweet honey, orange zest, caramel and clove. 

**Finish:** Medium and spicy. Lots of clove, allspice and tobacco. 

**Overall:** This was good and I enjoyed it but it was really striking how much the palate and finish reminded me of WT distillate. This isnt a bad thing, though, and the sample was quite enjoyable. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
