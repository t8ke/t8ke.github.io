**Distiller:** Westland

**Bottler:** Westland

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 57.8% ABV

**Age:** 30 Years

**Nose:**  Vanilla, caramel, some clove, cinnamon, lots more vanilla

**Taste:** VERY Sweet. Some prickly heat. Big vanilla, creamy caramel. Pepper, gingerbread. Very bourbon-y but much much sweeter. Good deal of cocoa. Hot, though.

**Finish:** Medium, nice and complex. Theres heat but its more in line here. Still really sweet.

**Overall:** Alright, things are getting better still. Im going to give this a Rank 6. Its a tad on the cloying sweet side but its got some really nice intense notes. I enjoyed this.

Thanks for reading!
