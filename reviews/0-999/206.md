[**Review #206 | Scotch Review #206 - Chivas Regal 1970**]( https://t8ke.review/review-206-chivas-regal-12yr-1970/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Chivas Regal

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, dough, rich lemon zest. Some yeasty sweetness and a mild bit of ethanol.

**Taste:** Mellow and slightly thin mouth feel but lots of doughy, custard, vanilla sweetness. Coupled with a fair amount of citrus and some nice lemon zest its light and almost dessert like.

**Finish:** Short and mildly astringent but sweet and filled with corn, grain and dough notes.    

**Overall:** Its really cool to taste really old stuff. I cant say its absurdly good but I do like it a lot. I need to get some modern Chivas to compare but something tells me that there might be a good bit of difference. I like that this dram is light, sweet and doughy for a blend thats undeniably not "top shelf". For that reason, Im scoring this dram a 6 - a cut above. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
