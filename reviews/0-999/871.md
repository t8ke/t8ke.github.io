**Distiller:** Balcones

**Bottler:** Balcones

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  53% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Floral and fragrant. Musty cardboard. Lots of ethanol. Caramel and some faint sweetness. 

**Taste:** Medium to thick mouth feel. Really reasonable heat on the palate. Musty wood, but not overwhelming. Caramel, raisin bread, toffee, oak and some cocoa. Faint tobacco.

**Finish:** Short, some heat, caramel and oak. Nice tobacco. No real musty or craft notes on the palate (hallelujah). Other than the heat, this seems perfectly alright. 

**Overall:** Overall, Im a bit impressed by this. I expected young, hot crafty and the only real offense I am seeing here is a bit more heat than Id like. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
