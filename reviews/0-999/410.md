[**Review #410 | Bourbon Review #410 - Old Ripy**]( https://t8ke.review/review-410-old-ripy-batch-1/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Campari

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet clove, cinnanmon, light corn. Thick rich vanilla cream, light mild citrus. Faint cocoa. Really, really reminiscent of many other WT products. From the nose, Id have assumed WT101. 

**Taste:** Nice and sweet. Creamy vanilla, some dough here. Theres a good bit of spice growing, nice clove is balancing the sweetness. Overall, its pretty rich flavor. 

**Finish:** Medium length. Sweet and balanced nicely by spice. Its really quintessential turkey throughout. 

**Overall:** Ill be straight with you all - Im not sure I could taste this against other WT products and tell it blind. This is NOT a bad thing. Sitting here, knowing its different it does seem a bit richer, but that could simply be power of suggestion. Overall, I really enjoy it. Theres no doubt that it comes from WT. If it were priced a little better - Id probably buy it. I like that some producers are releasing 375ml bottles - but I wish theyd stop pricing them like 750s and calling them LEs. Oh well.  

Thanks for reading!
