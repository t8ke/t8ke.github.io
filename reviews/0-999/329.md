**Distiller:** National Distillers

**Bottler:** National Distillers

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  57% ABV

**Nose:**  Sweet, punchy plums. Figs, jam, brown sugar, vanilla cream.

**Taste:** sweet thick oily plums. Mild sulfur, light grapes and figs. Plums, cocoa, faint pepper, heavy rich vanilla.

**Finish:** Long and sweet. Tons of earthy sweetness, lots of creamy toffee, coffee, cocoa and caramel. More cherry cordial notes blending well here with a lot of vanilla to finish out the ride. 

**Overall:** When I took a little sip and fired back my thoughts, I thought this was squarely a 7, perhaps even a 6 based on some astringency I was getting. Either way, though, I told him it was good. Definitely solid ND juice. However, after letting this sit for 20 minutes in a Glencairn and sitting down for a full review, there is no way this isnt an 8. That astringency is gone, the flavors are big and bold and honestly just delicious. This is a Rank 8 for me. Thanks again Volvo.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
