-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Redemption

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 55.3% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, brown sugar, oak, lots of vanilla. Not a lot of spice, not a lot of fruit. Some tobacco. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel, some young grassy notes. Clove, pepper, some spice here. Less caramel, some lightly malty notes, faint musty. No real fruits here but there is some pepper and astringency. Heat isnt terrible. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length, malty, musty, bitter with some astringency. Clove and pepper, faint orange peel, growing astringent with time. 

**Overall:** 

Thanks for reading!
