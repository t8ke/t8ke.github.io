[**Review #493 | Scotch Review #178 - 1961 Dewars White Label**]( https://t8ke.review/review-493-1961-dewars-white-label/)

**The Schtick:** This is a real dusty of sorts, hailing back to the very early 60s. Even then, this wasnt the stuff of luxury, but single malts werent really a thing in those days, either. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Dewar and Sons

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 43.4% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Bread, dough, honey and fruit. Vanilla extract, gingerbread and graham cracker. Lemon pepper. Faint smoke. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, pepper and lemon are the first big notes. Yellow cake, vanilla, roasted nuts and caramel. Fruity apple pie. 

**Finish:** Medium length, sweet smoke. Theres a lot of old funk, not sure if its from distillate or the sheer age. Almost has the meatiness of some really funky rums. Pepper, meaty bbq and some smoke are dominant here. More lemon meringue and some pepper. 

**Overall:** This was an incredibly interesting bottle to progress through. When we first opened this (opened it with pals) last September, it smelled like a dirty aquarium and was entirely offensive. Since then, over the course of gradually increasing air and more time open, its blossomed. Near the bottom half it was especially evident that there are very interesting things being blended in here. I cant really say what they are, because I have no idea, but the depth, richness and completely different profile from modern Dewars is fascinating. I consider this not only drinkable, but actually good at this point. Too bad it took so much pain to get to a good place. I will give this a 5 though, but thats as far as it can reach, even at its peak. 

Thanks for reading!
