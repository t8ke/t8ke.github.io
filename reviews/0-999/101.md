**The Schtick:** This comes from the Glengyle distillery. This is a yearly release from Kilkerran displaying a different maturation. This is #6 which features sherry wood.

**Distiller:** Glengyle

**Bottler:** Glengyle

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years

**Nose:**  Its sweet and smokey and the sherry peeks through. To be honest, I didnt have any idea what a typical Kilkerran profile is but I love the marrying of the sweet and smokey. The sherry is a great touch on top.  

**Taste:** Honey, smoke and sherry sit at the front. I get a lot of similar notes as some of the lighter Bruichladdichs Ive had in the past which is interesting given the regional difference. Its like a delicious barbecue in my mouth but with sherry introduced as well. 

**Finish:** Medium long and gentle. Well blended. The sherry really shines here peeking through the smoke. I like that the smoke is a bit heavier in the finish. Very savory. 

**Overall:** Interesting but delicious. Its a good product from Kilkerran.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
