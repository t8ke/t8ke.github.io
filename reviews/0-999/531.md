**The Schtick:** This is an 18yr blend in Chivas age stated core line of products. It costs around $70-$90 based on your market and in lieu of a semi-automatic, or just about any other personal defense weapon, can also serve as a bludgeoning device, regardless of whether it is full, or empty. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Chival Regal

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 18 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Honey, caramel and clove. Faint toffee. Pretty muted nose, but its all sweet. 

**Taste:** Thin, but no heat. Lots of sweetness like caramel, honey and pralines. Faint smoke, faint clove, faint pepper and faint sherry influence. Over time, the sherry and smoke are a little more noticeable but Id hardly call them bold. 

**Finish:** Short, no heat though. The sherry character and the smoke character are much bolder here and oddly enjoyable. Theres not a ton going on, but what is going on is nice. A lack of astringency or sulfur makes it pretty pleasant. 

**Overall:** This is generally one dimensional and unremarkable. The bottle also makes a great weapon. Its not mindblowing but its also certainly not bad. Good for company, guests or evenings you dont feel like thinking. 

Thanks for reading!
