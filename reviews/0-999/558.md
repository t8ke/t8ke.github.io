[**Review #558 | Scotch Review #199 - Compass Box No Name**]( https://t8ke.review/review-558-compass-box-no-name/)

**The Schtick:** We came across a parcel of American oak barrels filled with mature, massively peaty single malt whisky - tarry and full of bonfire-like smokiness. To us, this was a whisky crying out to be tamed and shaped into a very special Compass Box limited edition. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Compass Box

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 48.9% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Big, wet, slap of peat. Sulfur, burning tires, ash, umami, lemon lime buttercream, honey, melon and faint pepper. The Ardbeg is strong with this one. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, no heat. Ashy - burning tires and lumber. Dry, smoky peat. Caramel, waffles, lots of pepper and dead, dying things. 

**Finish:** Long with lots of lime, citrus, butter cream and honey with a long smoldering ashy departure. 

**Overall:** Really good but not completely mindblowing. Its unique and different but its completely an Ardbeg show. Which isnt a flaw by any stretch.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
