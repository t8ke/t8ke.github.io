[**Review #981 | Gin Review #10 - Primrose Gin**]( https://t8ke.review/review-981-primrose-gin/)

**The Schtick:** This is a gin that is distilled by Clear Springs Distilling in Louisville, Kentucky. It is owned and distributed by Sazerac. It seems peculiarly distributed, and despite the sporty label, it retails for around $10 USD. The label makes it appear that juniper, coriander, citrus and cassia are the primary botanicals.

**Nose:**  Honey, ethanol, coriander. Orange peel, confectioners sugar. Fruity, lightly herbal, sweet. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No heat. Vanilla bean, pepper, orange peel, creamy. Lots of light sweetness, some anise and juniper. 

**Finish:** Short, sweet and creamy. Lemon, cracked pepper, cardamom. 

**Overall:** Great mouth feel despite a short finish. Shockingly enjoyable. Id keep buying this at $10 with little to no regret. 

Thanks for reading!
