[**Review #145 | World Review #9 - Pendaryn Welsh Madeira**]( https://t8ke.review/review-145-pendaryn-welsh-madeira/)

**The Schtick:** This is Welsh distilled spirit matured in Madeira wine casks. Madeira, so hot, right now. 

-----

**Distiller:** Penderyn

**Bottler:** Penderyn

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Hay, straw, jam and strawberries. Reminds me strongly of smuckers. Raspberries, gusher like artificial fruit sweetness. Syrupy.

**Taste:** Sweet and syrupy. Funky fruit notes with some mustiness. This is definitely a madeira 

**Finish:** Medium  but not hot. Its gotten more complex but it still feels like gushers and smuckers strawberry jam going down.  

**Overall:** I want to like this whiskey and I can appreciate what it is doing but its just not for me. I hope to try more Penderyn soon and I love madeira finished whiskies so I think this just might be a modest miss for my tastes. I feel like I belong in the old folks home with the Smuckers over 100yo club drinking this. Maybe next time, my Welsh friends. 

Thanks for reading!
