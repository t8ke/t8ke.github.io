[**Review #126 | Scotch Review #51 - Scapa 16**]( https://t8ke.review/review-126-scapa-16/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 16yr age stated expression from Scapa, the often overlooked other island distillery.

-----

**Distiller:** Scapa

**Bottler:** Scapa

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 16 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla and almonds, theres some hay and a doughy sweetness also. Its nutty and sweet with some light icing notes, the tiniest lemon zest and more nutty fragrance. 

**Taste:** The mouth feel is a tiny bit thin but its sweet and inviting. Some hay and grain notes flourish with vanilla and some bakers icing carrying on in the back. Overall it isnt heavy or thick but light and oddly refreshing. 

**Finish:**  Medium and sort of flat. Its nutty and sweet and wisps away. There isnt too too much going on here but I enjoy it.

**Overall:** Scapa holds an odd place in my heart. Its delicious, aromatic and sweet in addition to a very nice balance. It goes well with a nice prime rib sandwich or a house cheeseburger and fried egg. If only their age stated stuff wasnt so hard to find these days.

Thanks for reading!
