[**Review #135 | Scotch Review #55 - Longmorn 15yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-135-longmorn-15/)

**The Schtick:** This is a now discontinued age stated product from Longmorn

-----

**Distiller:** Longmorn

**Bottler:** Longmorn

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  This is a sweet one - lots of natural honey, and a cornucopia of fruits. Sweet apple, pear, some honeydew. Lots of icing and sweet vanilla. The nose on this reminds me a lot of a bakery or a market with the sweet pastry and fruit notes playing off of each other. 

**Taste:** Very sweet with more honey, apples, pears and icing. Theres also some light, white grapes and a little bit of a funky strawberry, raisin note as well. Theres a tiny bit of funk here too. 

**Finish:**  The nose and palate are great but the finish gets a little strange. Its a bit hotter than I would have expected, or enjoyed and an odd plastic funk note creeps in. Its medium in duration and still very fruity but all I can think of is artificial, waxed fruit. 

**Overall:** Finish aside, this is still a pretty delicious dram. Certainly great for a warm summer night on the porch with a book. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
