**The Schtick:** This is a 10 year IB from Tamdhu that is bottled at cask strength and matured full term in a first fill sherry butt. 

-----

**Distiller:** Tamdhu

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage

**Selection:** Binnys

**ABV:** 60.5% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Toffee, caramel, some sherry funk and heavy, sweet cream.   

**Taste:** Its spicy at first and then the sweets roll in. Thick vanilla, toffee, caramel, sherry and some wood funk. Its delicious and its like dessert in a dram. Its dangerous, too. It drinks no where near 60%.  

**Finish:** Long and complex. Mild ethanol in the finish but accompanied with lots more sweet and sherry funk. I like the funk. Im glad it sticks around.  

**Overall:** This dram is everything I love at a price I could jizz over. Theres so many $50 bottles Ive bought I wish I could exchange for another of these. 

Thanks for reading!
