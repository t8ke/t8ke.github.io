**The Schtick:** NOW IN THE SEVENTH YEAR OF OUR ODYSSEY WE, THE FAMILY OF BRUICHLADDICH, WISH TO RECOGNISE AND PAY RESPECT TO SOME FRIENDS AND STALWARTS WHO HAVE SUPPORTED AND HELPED TO STEADY THE SHIP THROUGH THE MANY SQUALLS WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED ON OUR JOURNEY SO FAR. THEY ARE LOCAL HARD WORKING PEOPLE WHO ANSWERED THE CALL REGARDLESS OF THEIR OWN SITUATION, WITHOUT THEM AND MANY OTHERS IN OUR SMALL COMMUNITY WE WOULD HAVE STRUGGLED LONGER AND TRAVELLED LESS FAR. WE OFFER THEM OUR GRATITUDE AND HEARTFELT THANKS.

**Distiller:** Bruichladdich

**Bottler:** Bruichladdich

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  61% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years

**Nose:**   Hella sweet - tons of honey, bakery cakes and sweetness, almost nutty sherry notes. Faint hint at the peat to come, but the nose is all sweetness. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich. Really delicate heat. Sweet butterscotch, honey, cake and nutty sherry notes. Smoke rolls in - first its ashy, then  powerfully BBQ forward. It strikes a really incredible balance. 

**Finish:** Long, BBQ smoke on blast. The sweetness from the palate is more restrained here but blends very well, nonetheless. 

**Overall:** This is really amazing - far more so than I expected. The sweetness and complexity blend impressively with the smoke to make a really special dram. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
