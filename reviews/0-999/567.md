**The Schtick:** This is a pick done by a private group of individuals partnering with a store. It is 12 years old. Sorry for the garbage photo. High quality images will resume again tomorrow. 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** C+S Straight Up

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Caramel, ethanol, honey and vanilla. Smells like a delicious waffle cone. Lots of nice peanut brittle, also. 

**Taste:** Thick, rich and sweet. Lots of honey, vanilla and a complete lack of bitterness. Lots of caramel and some faint cocoa.

**Finish:** Long, lots of cinnamon, pepper and caramel. Heavy cocoa influence and some butter cream as well. 

**Overall:** This is a very good, off profile pick. I like it a lot as the oaky tannins are contained among lots of other "big" flavors and balance just right. This is how oak should exist in a pick.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
