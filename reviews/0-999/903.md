**The Schtick:** Longrow, one of the three producers under the Springbank umbrella of producers, is a Campeltown distiller that releases various peated expressions. This is their 18 year old release, which is part of their core line of expressions, though it comes and goes under a Limited Edition banner.

**Distiller:** Longrow

**Bottler:** Longrow

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 18 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Buttery and sweet. Caramel corn, salted caramel. Honey, apples and pears. Apple pie, almost, in that there is a nice bread-y quality (the crust), sweet apples and syrupy fruits (the filling) and some nice baking spices to round it out. Really nice overall. Not much peat in the nose, if any. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No real heat. Sweet cream, rich pepper and a touch of brine. Smoke rolls in - delicious ashy, burning wood, faint peppery peat. Mild rubber note, but very mild. Ashy all of the way. 

**Finish:** Long finish with really gentle heat. Peppery, lots of nice apple notes continue with buttery caramel and some tobacco. Really rich, grows drying but not bitter as the finish departs. 

**Overall:** This is a really great dram. Its complex and delicious while balancing smoke and dessert-y sweet notes with ease. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
