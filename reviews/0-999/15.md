[**Review #15 | Bourbon Review #13 - Buffalo Trace**]( https://t8ke.review/review-15-buffalo-trace/)

**The Schtick:** This is a Mashbill #1 product from Buffalo Trace. Generally available and usually reasonably price, this is more or less their "mass market" product - or an item in their core line. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, cinnamon and light butterscotch. There is no ethanol on the nose and everything blends together like a nice, light cinnamon roll of bourbon goodness. 

**Taste:** Its surprisingly complex and well blended, the vanilla is forefront and the cinnamon and spice back up the vanilla nicely. Overall, the mouthfeel is a bit thin but it coats nicely and all of the flavors are there. Its definitely BT Mashbill #1, and thats never a bad thing. Theres a faint hint of caramel and some light fruitiness. 

**Finish:** Its not terribly long, but its gentle on its way out. More vanilla and a hint of caramel, it leaves a pleasant warmth and a really great aftertaste that leaves you wanting another dram.   

**Overall:** This is a solid product with a lot going for it. Add in the very reasonable price (not considered in rating) and youve got a winner.  

Thanks for reading!
