[**Review #482 | Scotch Review #172 - Clynelish 14**]( https://t8ke.review/review-482-clynelish-14yr-ob/)

**The Schtick:** Clynelish is a Diageo owned distillery in Scotland. Typically, most of the distillerys product has gone to blends until recent years bottles of pure single malt Clynelish have become more popular. Also, a good deal of Clynelish product ends up in IBs. A common usual suspect is Compass Box, which favors Clynelish in a good deal of releases.

**Distiller:** Clynelish

**Bottler:** Clynelish

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 14 Years

**Nose:**  Sweet honey, pears, faint sherry. Doughy yeast, vanilla, caramel and a faint hint of briny smoke. Very faint, but noticeable. Balances beautifully. Very fruity, floral and sweet. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, nice and sweet though. Vanilla, honey, cream, floral sweetness, tart berries and some brine and smoke. 

**Finish:** Long and pleasant. The smoke grows and balances very well against the sweet notes that are in abundance in the palate. 

**Overall:** Man, this is delicious. I know its hip to crap on Diageo, but for what this is, its great. Its dangerously drinkable, entirely pleasant and since I opened it, Ive drank and enjoyed it all over the place. Most recently away preparing for a wedding (not mine). This is easy to rank well. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
