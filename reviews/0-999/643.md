**Bottler:** Brown-Forman

**Nose:**   Sweet honey, caramel, cotton candy. Clover, grassiness, toffee and confectioners sugar. Banana candy and light, faintly floral essence. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, sweet toffee, confectioners sugar. Faint pepper, surprisingly oaky, and overall a very sweet dram. 

**Finish:** Medium length, grassy essence returns, lots of toffee and sweet caramel. 

**Overall:** This was really shockingly enjoyable. It ss perhaps a bit too sweet, but still very enjoyable nonetheless.
