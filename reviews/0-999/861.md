**The Schtick:** "Queens Share rum was known to be the best barrels in a distillery &amp; reserved for royalties special occasions. It takes meticulous distilling, additional cut collection, re-distillation, &amp; extended aging to fulfill its promise of dense flavor &amp; plush texture. Sadly it became a victim of bottom lines &amp; large volume manufacturing. We take great pride in being a part of this traditional rums revival.

**Distiller:** Privateer

**Bottler:** Privateer

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 54.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, ethanol, lemon candies. Lightly musty, sweet confectioners sugar. Not super rich, or robust.  

**Taste:** Musty, sweet sugar. Faint molasses. High proof, and its evident. Werthers candies, light confectioners sugar. Not super rich mouth feel. Candied apples, faint banana, sweet, hot. 

**Finish:** Short, hot, caramel, grain, some apple. 

**Overall:** This was a bit of a let down overall compared to the other privateer releases I have had. It was generally thin, far too hot, and didnt really back up that heat with viscosity or robust flavors. 

Thanks for reading!
