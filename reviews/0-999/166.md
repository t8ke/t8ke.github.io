[**Review #166 | Rye Review #91 - Willett Family Estate 6yr SiB Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-166-wfe-single-barrel-rye-64-6yr-re-review/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Willett

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  55% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Molasses, brown sugar, theres some pine and dough notes with a good deal of light minty freshness.  

**Taste:** Theres dill, mint and sugar. Hot but delicious. Sweetness really flows in with more woodiness, brown sugar and maples. Theres some odd confectioners sugar too but that isnt as prominent as the others. 

**Finish:** This one is long and minty. Warm but really satisfying. A little rough though. The mint here though is definitely more spearmint than dill which really to me is what sets it apart from SAOS 7yr (apart, not above). lots of rich sugar here too. 

**Overall:** I dont know what a bottle of this goes for since I traded for the end of this fella but its satisfying and delicious. Worth up to $60 or so in my eyes since thats what Id pay before I really started to get suspicious of the quality. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
