**The Schtick:** This was supposed to be a mystery, but became an unmystery about half way through when the person holding the reveal sheet accidentally revealed the answer. So I give you, a half mystery. But a whole review. Math is weird in whiskey land. 

-----

**Distiller:** Highland Park

**Bottler:** Highland Park

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 55.8% ABV

**Age:** 16 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Earthy, funky peat. Minearility, some BBQ. Really dirty earth. Sweet vanilla, caramel, toffee, honey. Some stewed fruits, thick syrupy strawberry. Really funky, in a good way. 

**Taste:** Thick, syrupy sweet. Some pepper, honey, vanilla, stewed fruits. Earthy peat, some smoke, savory bbq. Faint iodine. Really aggressive peat for HP, but it blends with the wine notes very well. 

**Finish:** Long, some heat, but complex. Earthy peat blended with syrupy stewed fruits. 

**Overall:** his is Highland Park Odin. Post, you are a generous man. It is very good. Damn good. I like it a lot. Id never spend $$ on this, so this is a real treat. Now to hunt my final Highland Park wish list bottle - a 15+ yr, cask strength, 100% first fill sherry or madeira. Its out there...probably not. Maybe? But I still want it. 

Thanks for reading!
