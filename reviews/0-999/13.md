[**Review #13 | Bourbon Review #11 - Old Grand Dad Bottled in Bond (2015)**]( https://t8ke.review/review-13-old-grand-dad-bottled-in-bond/)

**The Schtick:** Sitting between OGD86 and OGD114, this is Old Grand Dad Bottled in Bond. The Bottled in Bond act is one of the most well known pieces of legislature in bourbon, and it helps ensure consumers saw quality products after prohibition, and helped the government see some nice tax income also. Lets see how it is.  

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 4 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  It smells like a solid bourbon. Brown sugar, cinnamon, a tiny bit of wood. If this came as a Glade plugin, Id buy it. 

**Taste:** Tastes like a literal dram of butter. I like it. A lot. Vanilla follows through along with a little hint of taffy. No spice and theres very very little burn for a 100pf. 

**Finish:** Longer than the WT101 and still very buttery. It teeters on the edge of some caramel/nougat notes too, which seems very fitting for the holidays.  

**Overall:** This is a phenomenal bottling, especially for the value. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
