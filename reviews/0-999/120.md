**The Schtick:** This is a well aged, reasonably proofed release from Signatory Vintage using product sourced from Glenrothes

-----

**Distiller:** Glenrothes

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 11 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Theres a lot going on here and it smells just like a bakery, and I love it. Theres warm toffee, theres some light sherry and a good dose of vanilla. This isnt bourbon vanilla, its gentle pastry vanilla, much like icing on a cake or pastry, very rich but sweet. Theres nothing but sweet on the nose on this one. 

**Taste:** The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but its funky and sweet nonetheless. Theres a good deal of vanilla sweetness and more toffee. If this was proofed up, it would probably remind me of a Tamdhu from past reviews. Theres some thin sherry sweetness, but its mild and I cant tell if the dram is initially fruity or if this is some mild sherry influence. 

**Finish:** Its medium in duration and develops a mild tart note. The sweetness is still there, fruity and sweet and leaves some floral notes on the tongue. Theres a touch of ethanol too which is strange since this is the first time it has become apparent.

**Overall:** I enjoyed this. Very sweet and balanced. 

Thanks for reading!
