**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** 

**Bottler:** 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 21 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Fruity creamy spicey. Probably rye I think. Not a lot of metal or dill but its got punch and bite. Oddly fruity though.

**Taste:** Moderately thick mouth feel and no alcohol at all. Spicy and a lot like cleaning chemical though - astringency is a big player here. Minor lemon, some pine, some dough. Mostly astringent despite the lack of ethanol     

**Finish:** Medium length. Oddly prickly and hot, ethanol spiking in. Mellow at the same time. Definitely rye, I think but its really mellow. Very dark so Im guessing 7+ years but maybe a hair more.  

**Overall:** There is a reason this is a 21yr rye selling for ~$60 or so here. Its good - I dont actively dislike it but its all over the place. Fruity, hot, astringent, spicy.

Thanks for reading!
