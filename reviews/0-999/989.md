**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottler release of spirit distilled by Hampden Estate in Jamaica. The rum was aged in Jamaica, then shipped up to Kentucky for bottling, where it was bottled at cask strength by Barrell Bourbon. 

-----

**Distiller:** Hampden

**Bottler:** Barrell Bourbon

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 67.365% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Thick, rich caramel. Nutty sweetness. Tons of signature Jamaican funk - overripe rotting bananas, papaya, orange. Distinctly meaty, but less so than some other past releases Ive had from Jamaican rums. Really rich caramel and fruit notes make this an interesting start.  

**Taste:** Banana, massive searing funk. Mild heat with a thick, rich mouth feel. Toffee, nougat, no artificial sweetness on the palate. Mild rubber, faint plastic before a final burst of banana, orange, papaya and rich meaty funk. 

**Finish:** Long, rich. A bit more heat here, but not unwieldy. Tons of sweet fruit, funky rubber, meaty sweetness. Caramel. The papaya and rotting banana are prominent, putting the funk in the backseat on the finish. 

**Overall:** This is really impressive. Honestly, Barrell Bourbon has done ok to good things in the bourbon world, but this rum selection at their hands is really well done. Ill put myself in the camp of wishing that they stick to rum and rebrand. This was rich, signature Hampden with a unique focus and I loved the hell out of it. 

Thanks for reading!
