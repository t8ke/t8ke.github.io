[**Review #395 | Scotch Review #395 - Glen Moray 12**]( https://t8ke.review/review-395-glen-moray-12/)

**The Schtick:** A no frill Speyside for not a lot of dollars. 

-----

**Distiller:** Glen Moray

**Bottler:** Glen Moray

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Pears, apples, vanilla. Faint honey, lemon and walnuts. 

**Taste:** Sweet apples, pears and lemons. Very reminiscent of a young, thin Fiddich. Sweet, light, unoffensive.  

**Finish:** Short, no burn, just sweet. 

**Overall:** Its a sweet one-hitter. Its inexpensive, nearly abundant everywhere and other than the short finish, brief stab of astringency in the palate and the general familiarity of introductory drams, its fine. Im giving it a 4. Id rather have something like Balvenie 10 or 12DW but the increase in complexity, although definitely noticeable, isnt massive. A little more complexity would have easily made this a Rank 5. This is fine, but completely boring. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
