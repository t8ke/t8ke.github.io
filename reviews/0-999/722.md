**The Schtick:** "Nikkas entry-level whisky from Miyagikyo distillery. Light in body, yet full of flavour, this is an excellent introduction to Japanese whisky. Elegantly fruity with sherry-cask character." - The Whiskey Exchange

**Distiller:** Nikka

**Bottler:** Nikka

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Nose:**  Melon, honey, wet cardboard and vanilla 

**Taste:** Thin, sweet, some green young character, faintly vegetal. Some minor heat, vanilla and light fruity character.

**Finish:** Short, medium length, mildly doughy. 

**Overall:** Overall, I found this young and generally unremarkable. It wasnt actively bad, but lacked a lot of positive character.

Thanks for reading!
