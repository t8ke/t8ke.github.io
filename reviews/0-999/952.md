**The Schtick:** This is a single grain whiskey that is 6 years old and finished in a Burgundy cask. No timeline for the length of the finish. 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Hyde

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet honey, bread and ethanol. Lots of icing, some faint juicy raspberry notes. Not a ton of depth here but its sweet and generally inoffensive.  

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel, no real heat. Sweet vanilla, cocoa, fresh baked bread, mild plastic note, juicy fruits like cherry, raspberry and some pear. 

**Finish:** Short, no heat. Bready, some astringency and a faint bitterness. Honey, melon, light raspberry, thats about it. 

**Overall:** This was the expression I was most excited for, but unfortunately it was the most disappointing. It was vapid, not really that complex and lacked almost any sort of wine influence. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
