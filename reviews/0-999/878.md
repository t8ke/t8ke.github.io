**The Schtick:** This is a official distillery bottling of 14 year old Tomatin spirit that has been finished for some length in a port cask. Knowing Tomatin, this finish was relatively short compared to the overall age of the spirit. 

-----

**Distiller:** Tomatin

**Bottler:** Tomatin

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 14 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet honey, sour fruits. Tart, faintly lactic. Faint oak presence. Fairly muted nose, all things considered.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No heat. Completely different from the nose. Sweet, creamy, vanilla. Rich cocoa. Some oak, pepper, tobacco. Nice port influence. Very sweet cherry, currant, some berries. Thick mouth feel, especially for the proof.

**Finish:** Long, rich and sweet. Cocoa and faint pepper blends really nicely with rich vanilla, some toffee and a nice fruit presence. 

**Overall:** I really enjoyed this, and wish it was sold in my neck of the woods. Great stuff.

Thanks for reading!
