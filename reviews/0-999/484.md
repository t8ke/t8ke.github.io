[**Review #484 | Scotch Review #173 - Dalmore 12 Year**]( https://t8ke.review/review-484-dalmore-12yr-ob/)

**The Schtick:** This is the base, age stated release in Dalmores core line. 

-----

**Distiller:** Dalmore

**Bottler:** Dalmore

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Mildly lactic, sweet raisin bread, sweet caramel and faint cocoa. Theres some odd fruitiness, melons and faint banana. 

**Taste:** Thin and again, mildly lactic. faint brown sugar, tastes young, almost as if there is some new make spirit in the mix. Raisin bread notes are here again.

**Finish:** Short and mildly funky. Lactic, sweet fruitiness, that young note dominates again. 

**Overall:** This is nothing like I expected and nothing like I really remember Dalmore spirit to be like. Interesting. I am really looking forward to trying more expressions again to formally review. That said, I just didnt love this one. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
