[**Review #91 | Bourbon Review #51 - Jeffersons Chef Collaboration Batch 12**]( https://t8ke.review/review-91-jeffersons-chef-collab-batch-12/)

**The Schtick:** Jeffersons Chef Collab, a line of of products promoted by gimmicks, within a brand promoted entirely with gimmicks. This one was supposedly picked by a chef.

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Jeffersons

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, lots of cream, theres a very mild fruit spice here. Its intriguing!

**Taste:** Some spice, a minor metallic note and then lots of oaky, woody vanilla. I keep waiting for more to show up but its oddly woody. 

**Finish:** Its medium and well blended with lots of wood, cream and a healthy dash of spice. 

**Overall:** I expected really big, bold things from a chefs collaboration but then i sat down to think about it. Maybe the money is in the subtlety. Theres nothing off putting about this dram but I was kind of expecting something to swoop in on the palate and bring out some big flavors.

Thanks for reading!
