[**Review #60 | Scotch Review #23 - Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban**]( https://t8ke.review)

**The Schtick:** This expression from Glenmorangie features their base, 10 year old, spirit matured an extra 2 years in ruby port.

-----

**Distiller:** Glenmorangie

**Bottler:** Glenmorangie

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Thick grape and wine sweetness. Oak and vanilla.  

**Taste:** Port forward sweetness. Oily mouth feel. Cinnamon, vanilla and a little spice. Over time though (couple of months), oddly it becomes more lactic and bitter. 

**Finish:** Short but gentle. Lots of red fruit. 

**Overall:** Tastes like a glass of port wine made it into my scotch. One thing to note though is that the characteristic Glenmorangie bitterness makes itself known after a couple months of being open. I try to review as I work my way through a bottle and by the bottom, this was pretty disappointing compared to the first couple drams. This is unusual, its not something often noticed by me, but its very evident here. 

Thanks for reading!
