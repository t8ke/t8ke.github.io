**The Schtick:** This is the Fall 2012 Release of Buffalo Traces coveted Antique Collection member: Eagle Rare 17yr. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** 17 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Fruity sawdust, oaky, cocoa, caramel, rich pepper. Really quite fruity. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, no heat, cocoa, oaky sawdust, fruity. Its actually super fruity, loaded with raspberry, melon, passion fruit, vanilla and caramel. Its everything I like about an off the shelf Eagle Rare 10yr Pick, but amplified a bit. The oak really helps to balance what could easily be runaway sweetness, as well. 

**Finish:** Oaky, peppery, nice oak and sawdust notes. It is definitely mash bill 1 but balances really well with the soft oak character.

**Overall:** Damn good, if a hair underproofed. If this was cask strength, I bet it would be awesome, but we can all surmise why it is not. That said, its not over oaked and delivers a floral, fruity, faintly oaky profile with great proficiency and zero bitterness. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
