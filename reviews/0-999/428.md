[**Review #428 | Bourbon Review #428 - Elmer T Lee 2006 Kentucky Barrel Society**]( https://t8ke.review/review-428-elmer-t-lee-2006/)

**The Schtick:** I scoff pretty heavily at ETL these days. Thin, earthy, rutabaga juice. This pick comes from over a decade ago - was Elmer much different then?

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** Kentucky Barrel Society

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, musty dirt, cloves, caramel and some funky dusty leather / tobacco. Lots of toffee - its definitely sweet and funky, but in more of a nuanced, tasteful way. I understand thats vague and ambiguous, but its almost like a lighty peated funky scotch in the way that its unique but tastefully done. The load of caramel helps too. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, much richer than some of the recent years Ive had. Lots of caramel and vanilla here and some light fruitiness - this almost tastes like a blend of Mashbill 1 and 2 from BT rather than being solidly MB2. Light passion fruit, honey, vanilla, and a little bit of cocoa. 

**Finish:** Medium length, no heat though. Funky earthiness returns with some caramel, rich cocoa and oak, and some vanilla. 

**Overall:** This is completely different than the recent bottles of Elmer that I have had. Thats not to say its wildly superior but it is certainly very different. This could be the result of the Society picking an off profile barrel, of course. All in all, though, I really enjoyed how unique this was compared to how painfully boring ETL typically is. 

Thanks for reading!
