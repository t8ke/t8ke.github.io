**The Schtick:** This is my first taste of a Dallas Dhu product, but I am looking forward to it. This is an independent bottling of their spirit, bottled by Gordon and MacPhail. 

-----

**Distiller:** Dallas Dhu

**Bottler:** Godron MacPhail

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 34 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Super effervescent. Lemon, lime, apples, pears, vanilla. Not super complex, but light, fruity and pleasant.   

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, no real heat. Vanilla, cream, apples, pears, honey and lemons. Faint tobacco. Faint sulfur. 

**Finish:** Medium length, mild heat with lots of fruity vanilla character.

**Overall:** Nice and light, enjoyable but not super complex. For 34 years in oak, this shows the vanilla character very well without trampling the fruity characteristics of the base spirit.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
