[**Review #829 | Rye Review #447 - Copper Pony Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-829-copper-pony-rye/)

**The Schtick:** This is a Total Wine house brand that is sourced from TerraPURE in the Carolinas - a company that "hyper ages" distills products by attempting to age them faster than conventionally possible using a proprietary method. They claim that this process will revolutionize the industry by providing producers with products that are comparable to well aged bourbons and ryes, in just a fraction of that time. Lets see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** TerraPURE

**Bottler:** TerraPURE for Total Wine

**Selection:** N/A

**Nose:**  Wet cardboard, musty, oats, sugar

**Taste:** Sweet, caramel, musty, cardboard, green, super young

**Finish:** Short, rough, hot, overwhelmingly musty and young, super fake

Thanks for reading!
