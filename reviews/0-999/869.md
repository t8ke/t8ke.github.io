[**Review #869 | Scotch Review #292 - The Macallan Edition 2**]( https://t8ke.review/review-869-the-macallan-edition-no-2/)

**The Schtick:** This is the second edition released by Macallan under the Edition line of expressions. 

-----

**Distiller:** Macallan

**Bottler:** Macallan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 48.2% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich sherry, honey, fresh baked bread. Syrupy figs, cherry, stewed fruits. Super jammy. Lots of maple and brown sugar. 

**Taste:** Lots of pepper, sweet sherry notes. Lots of cocoa and vanilla bean as well. Rich syrupy strawberry, raspberry, stewed figs and a really nice tobacco undertone. 

**Finish:** Short to medium, not a lot of heat. Oak, subtle pepper and a really nice sherry exit. The vanilla bean is especially notable, followed by lots of stewed fruits. 

**Overall:** This was definitely different than the Edition 1. It was relieving to see that astringent plastic note replaced with more sherry and the introduction of a little cocoa. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
