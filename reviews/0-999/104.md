[**Review #104 | Bourbon Review #58 - Top of the Hill 8 Oak**]( https://t8ke.review/review-104-top-of-the-hill-8-oak/)

**The Schtick:** This is a craft offering from Top of the Hill in NC. 

-----

**Distiller:** Top of the Hill

**Bottler:** Top of the Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Fruity vegetal funk. Wood, oaky pepper and this odd candy sweet note.

**Taste:** Thin and fruity. Sweet and this odd jolly rancher note perpetuates. Mild spice and some vanilla.

**Finish:** Short, hot and laced with this new funky candy/bubblegum note. This is one unique whiskey.

**Overall:** I had no idea what to expect and Im still a little unsure of this guy. Its not great, or even really good as Id rate it but its really unique and interesting despite its poster board of flaws. Whether this is their intended goal or not, I have no idea.

Thanks for reading!
