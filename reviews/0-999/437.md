[**Review #437 | Scotch Review #437 - Talisker 57 North**]( https://t8ke.review/review-437-talisker-57-north/)

**The Schtick:** This is a travel retail exclusive edition of Talisker.  

-----

**Distiller:** Talisker

**Bottler:** Talisker

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  57% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  First whiff of ethanol, but its nice and refreshing. Salt and pepper, faint honey cream, some vanilla, lemon zest, sea air. A bit more smoky than Talisker 10 here.  

**Taste:** I expected a more rich mouth feel but this wasnt thick at all. Not really a problem but it is coupled with some intense heat. I appreciate that it is at higher proof, but its almost difficult to pull some notes through the heat. Its briny and peppery, theres some faint citrus and a hint of cream. Overall, its hot and peppery, with a hint of Talisker sea air. 

**Finish:** Nice long finish with some heat, but much more tame than the finish. Lots of pepper here, making it fairly one dimensional. 

**Overall:** I enjoyed the proofed up experience of Talisker 57 North but this just isnt what I hoped it would be. Given that it is a NAS Travel Exclusive, I have no doubt that lower quality casks along with younger casks probably help make up this blend and its pretty evident in the dram. That being said, it wasnt really terrible but Id love to see a 10yr CS or even a DE CS. Those would be incredible, I think. 

Thanks for reading!
