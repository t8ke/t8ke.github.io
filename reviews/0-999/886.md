[**Review #886 | Bourbon Review #466 - Old Forester Single Barrel Ottos Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-886-old-forester-single-barrel-ottos-selection/)

**The Schtick:** This is a single barrel of Old Forester spirit that was selected by a local retailer. It was matured in Warehouse G, on Floor 2, and was bottled at 45% ABV. I really wish this was bottled at cask strength, but I gave it a go, regardless.

**Distiller:** Brown-Forman

**Bottler:** Brown-Forman

**Selection:** Ottos

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Bananas, vanilla, clove, oak. Not a ton going on here, I could probably mistake it for Signature or Jack Daniels SiB blind.

**Taste:** Medium, bananas, toffee, caramel, vanilla, cream, oak. Nice body, but its pretty squarely an Old Forester product. Banana is unmistakable. 

**Finish:** Short, uninspiring, vanilla, clove. Mild heat. 

**Overall:** Great nose and palate, nonexistent finish. I really enjoyed some aspects of this, but it didnt seem off the mark from a variety of other Old Forester products that already exist. Cask strength might have made this special. In the end, its good and fine, if not remarkable.

Thanks for reading!
