[**Review #609 | Scotch Review #203 - Glenburgie 18yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-609-glenburgie-18/)

**The Schtick:** This was part of a blind mystery package that a buddy sent along. I sampled, posted my notes live in the Discord server and got the reveal so that I could fill in the pertinent information for this posting. Thanks, Post!

**Distiller:** Glenburgie

**Bottler:** Glenburgie

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 18 Years

**Nose:**   Sweet honey. Vanilla, melon and citrus. Lime? Pepper. Like a delicious lemon bar from a bakery. Faint pepper and salinity. Hint of sulfur. Vanilla is really prominent and the other flavors accent very nicely. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, no heat. Sweet vanilla buttercream, mild pepper, some faint smoke and salinity. Almost a hint of savory. Butter cream returns with faint citrus and a mildly lactic presence. 

**Finish:** Long, really complex - lots of vanilla, doughy cakebread, faint pepper and some lemon bar. 

**Overall:** Im pretty confident this is an unpeated single malt, no real wine finishing here. The lactic, sweetness, citrus, faint savory notes and the hint of salinity make me pretty confident in my guess: This is an older Bruichladdich bottling, probably something like Laddie 16, or Laddie 20+ given the complexity and wonderful citrus + vanilla. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
