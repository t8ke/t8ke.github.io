[**Review #853 | Bourbon Review #455 - Homestead Barrel proof**]( https://t8ke.review/review-853-homestead-barrel-proof-bourbon/)

**The Schtick:** This is a craft bourbon whiskey that is sourced from MGP/LDI in Indiana and bottled by Homestead in Iowa. I originally did not realize this because I took notes before doing research as a measure to avoid bias, and it explains my befuddlement at Homestead not being flaming, but not flaming garbage. 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Homestead

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 56.65% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Waffles, vanilla, cream, clove. Faintly fruity, nice caramel presence. A really deceptive nose, in a good way. 

**Taste:** Medium, some heat. Rich caramel, cloves, pepper. No real signs of youth, which is immensely relieving. Tobacco, some bitterness, cocoa. 

**Finish:** Medium, but hot. Cocoa, caramel, waffle cone, nutty, with some caramel. 

**Overall:** This is really impressive compared to a variety of other craft bottlings but its a bit hot. Like really hot. No signs of gross youth though, and I love the combination of cocoa and sweetness on the palate, so this is scoring well in my book, all things considered. This is, of course, all explained by the origins at everyones favorite producer, MGP in Indiana, but the barrels seem sourced well enough with the major downfall here being the lack of age to mellow out that searing proof. 

Thanks for reading!
