**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  65% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**   Super sweet - caramel, toffee, vanilla. Fruity sweetness: passion fruit, melon, cherries. Faint ethanol, faint oakiness. Loaded with honey, faint cocoa undertones.

**Taste:** Thick, rich, loaded with caramel, toffee and subtle oak. Some bitterness, but its pretty subdued. There is pretty evident heat, but its not punishing for the proof. Lots of fruitiness also. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and balanced nice with some peppery oak. Very sweet still - the toffee, cocoa and cherries are real here. 

**Overall:** This is nice and I like it as much than some of the other batches that are more recent. Their consistency is honed in and well executed.

Thanks for reading!
