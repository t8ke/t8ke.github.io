**The Schtick:** This is a cask strength rye released under the Knob Creek label by Beam/Suntory. This comes from Warehouse A and is bottled at 59.8% ABV. I worked through a bottle of this, but was dumb enough to not take a bottle kill picture. 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 59.8% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Toffee, clove, pepper, rye spice. Nice sweetness. Some musty oak. Little bit of light spearmint, but very little. Could be a little green vegetation.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Honey, toffee, caramel. Waffles and syrup. Rye spice. Lots of clove, pepper and tobacco. Mild heat, but not punishing despite being almost 60% ABV.

**Finish:** Long, a bit more heat here, but lots of pepper, cloves, tobacco and some real robust oak. 

**Overall:** This really changes over time, starting as sweet and almost vegetal and transforming into a dry, bold, oaky rye. I really dig it, and think its about time that KC gives us something like this. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
