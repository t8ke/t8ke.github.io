[**Review #417 | Scotch Review #417 - That Boutique-y Whisky Company 50yr Blend #1**]( https://t8ke.review/review-417-that-boutiquey-50yr-blend-1/)

**The Schtick:** That Boutique-y Whisky Company released a variety of IB products. This is their first blend product to be released and carries a 50 year age 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** That Boutique-y Whisky Company

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 46.6% ABV

**Age:** 50 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Very perfumey, aromatic. Coffee cake, cocoa, vanilla and a whole lot of caramel. Some interesting fruit notes here, some sherry personality. Apples, some pears, a whole lot of raspberry jammy notes.

**Taste:** Nice rich mouthfeel. Lots of cocoa, sherry notes. Oak, chocolate, coffee and pound cake, pepper and jammy raspberry and strawberry notes. Nice spice and a hint of really strange herbal essence like anise maybe? Really well balanced regardless. Flavors married very well.

**Finish:** Medium to long, no heat. Sweet sherry and delicious peppery leather notes. Like a nice dessert balanced very well with wood influence.  

**Overall:** This is good. No wait, this is great. The second 50yo product Ive had in a couple days, and this was no let down. I love the diversity here, the careful balance between oak, vanilla, sherry notes and even a hint of anise. Really delicious. 

Thanks for reading!
