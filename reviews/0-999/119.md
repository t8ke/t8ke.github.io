[**Review #119 | Scotch Review #47 - Kilchoman 5yr Single Cask ex-bourbon**]( https://t8ke.review/review-119-kilchoman-5yr-ex-bourbon/)

**The Schtick:** Admittedly, the label got ripped off of this sample, so its time for a little adventure. 

-----

**Distiller:** Kilchoman

**Bottler:** Kilchoman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**    % ABV

**Age:** 5 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  It smells like a Subway. Thats right. And this is a good thing. I mean the sandwich shop, if there was any confusion. Theres a great variety of doughy yeast sweetness, vegetal notes floating throughout and some earthy tones as well. Theres also a nice waft of vanilla and a good deal of woody cinnamon. 

**Taste:** Its smokey and peaty. Theres slight vegetation but not to the rotting moss level. Theres some savory barbecue and a good deal of ash here as well. I like Kilchoman because their take on peat is very different than the other major players and I think this does them well.  

**Finish:** Its long but relatively hot. Im not sure of the proof but I wouldnt put it much over 100pf. Theres more peat and vanilla, with the dough and BBQ notes taking a backseat. 

**Overall:** Its not the best whiskey Ive ever had but its interesting and complex and really quite unique. Ive said it before, but I look forward to seeing what Kilchoman does as the years tick by. 

Thanks for reading!
