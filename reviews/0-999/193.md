**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** KLWines

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Dull spearmint and dill notes followed by char and confectioners sugar. Theres also this funky but oddly tasty marshmallow note Im picking up.     

**Taste:** Mellow and sweet with only a little hint of rye spice. No dill to speak of here and an odd orchard fruitiness. Apples and strawberries and cream with some faint clove and a modest helping of punchy rye. Its balanced but far fruitier and sweet than Id expect given the age.       

**Finish:** Medium, fudgey and spicy. Heres that rye spice. Some cherry cola notes, still no dill and only faintly minty. Sweet, fruity and unique.      

**Overall:** This one took me a long time to figure out. I initially went back and forth because this dram throws a lot at you. Fruits, sweets, then spice, then sweet, then dill, then spice. All over the place. Eventually though, after savoring it all, I realized I liked it a great deal. I wish it was punchier and more bold but for what it was, I really found myself enjoying every sip. For this reason, Im giving it a Rank 7 rating. This might shock some of you - it certainly surprised me at the end how much I missed it when it was gone. With a rating like this, the TAOS 17yr Rye sits among High West Rendezvous Rye, WhistlePig 10yr rye and SAOS 7yr Rye. Thanks for reading!

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
