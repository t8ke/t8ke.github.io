[**Review #224 | Bourbon Review #126 - Old Fitzgerald Bottled in Bond "01 Stamped Bottle" Bernheim Distilled**]( https://t8ke.review/review-224-old-fitzgerald-2001-bernheim/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Bernheim

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet woody vanilla, cola notes and some root beer as well. Its sweet and woody but very well balanced. Minor molasses in the background but very cola forward.

**Taste:** Medium but richer than the modern bottling. More molasses and cola with some lingering clove, vanilla and a hint of root beer float. Weird, I know. Theres some heat - this definitely isnt a top shelf bourbon given its age but its good and the heat isnt excessive for the proof.

**Finish:** Medium and a bit hotter but still thick in the maple / cola / molasses / vanilla camp. No spice and very sweet forward but its a bit different than other typical bourbon profiles thats a bit hard to explain.

**Overall:** Overall, Im pretty happy with this bottle. Its good quality for the price, especially given that it is a liter bottling. I like how unique the flavor profile is being very cola forward and sweet with only mild oakiness that lends itself more to sweet than bitter. Its always fun to take a sip of history. Im rating this dram a 6 - its great for the price and uniqueness but lets not fool ourselves into thinking that this is the worlds best bottle - despite what the secondary may say. This is certainly well above the modern day bottling though and I enjoyed it very much!

Thanks for reading!
