**The Schtick:** This is a 21yr bottling of Clynelish distillate that was aged for 20 years in Oloroso sherry casks and transitioned to a first fill PX cask for the final year of maturation. It is bottled at cask strength, NCF, with no color added, by the SMWS

-----

**Distiller:** Clynelish

**Bottler:** SMWS

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  56% ABV

**Age:** 21 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Sugar, honey, toffee, waxed fruits, sour milk, nutty sherry, fruity. Tobacco, rich cocoa.

**Taste:** Thick, rich, pepper, stewed fruits, milk ash smoke, caramel, Dole fruit syrup. Super rich. Astounding complexity. 

**Finish:** Long, rich no heat, sweet caramel, bread-y yeasty sweet caramel. Mild smoke, pepper, oak, stewed fruits. Rich sherry balances well with oak and rich spirit 

**Overall:** Really quite great but cant live up to some other SMWS Clynelish Ive had. That in no way is a knock, though, because this was fantastic. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 9**
