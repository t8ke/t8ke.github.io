**Nose:**  Sweet vanilla poundcake. Floral and perfumey. It reminds me of the delicate fruity nature of Clynelish spirit a little bit. Its nice and sweet, like a bakery in the sprintime. Its pretentious to say, I know, but the notes are there: fruits, yeaty dough, honey, vanilla, some faint clove, floral perfume, etc.

**Taste:** Sweet and creamy - almost like dessert. Nice mouth feel for the proof. Mildly fruity here with a big emphasis on doughy vanilla notes. Hint of cinnamon and sugar.

**Finish:** Medium in length - no heat. Sweet and very pleasant.

**Overall:** This is no big bold dram. This is not a bad thing. I really enjoy the balance here and quite honestly, it surprised me. Theres a great balancing act here of sweet and floral, neither overpowering the other. This seems like a lovely dram for a summer evening on the porch watching the sky bronze over, or after a nice meal in the dead of winter. I regret not trying Craiggelachie sooner. Rank 6.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
