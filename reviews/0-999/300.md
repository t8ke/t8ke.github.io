**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Clynelish

**Bottler:** SMWS

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 57.6% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, dough, thick waxy fruit notes. Lemons, buttercream, apples, pears, faint strawberry. Bakery spices and sweets like faint toffee, sweet caramel, buttercream. Grows a tiny bit spicy with the waxiness picking up. 

**Taste:** Thick, rich mouth feel. Oily, coats well. Heat is very much in check for the proof. Honey, almonds, mild pepper. Apple, lemon zest, toffee. This is amazing and complex. Its like dessert but balanced incredibly well against the waxy dough notes and some faint pepper. Unbelievable. 

**Finish:** This goes on for ages. Complex, deep, long. Waxy fruit and toffee for days. 

**Overall:** This is phenomenal. Absolutely phenomenal. For scale, /u/devilsadvocate and I tried this against two Brora samples and a St. Mag sample and I think we were both in agreement that this was better. The richness, complexity, mouth feel, signature Clynelish waxed fruit notes all showed up in force and blew me away. I saved some for a formal, standalone review (this is the product of that) on Christmas and it was the best Christmas ever. 

Thanks for reading!
