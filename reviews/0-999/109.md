**The Schtick:** This is a 16 year IB from Mortlach that is bottled at cask strength and finished for 33 months in an Oloroso sherry butt.

-----

**Distiller:** Mortlach

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage 

**Selection:** Binnys

**ABV:** 55.3% ABV

**Age:** 16 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Light malted grain, hay and honey. Sherry and faint wine paired with delicious brine (I rhymed!)

**Taste:** Brine, sherry and some mild drifting smoke. Minor plastic notes and then the marzipan, oloroso sweetness and some dark chocolate flood in. Faint meatiness and musty tobacco. 

**Finish:** Medium but gentle. Also doesnt drink like its character would suggest, but its still pretty high in the ABV department. Theres a good deal of hay and sherry. Lots more funk here though.  

**Overall:** Once again, another insane value put forth by the Signatory gods (hail). 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
