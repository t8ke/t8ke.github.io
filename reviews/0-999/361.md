**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Glenfiddich

**Bottler:** Glenfiddich

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 14 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Apples, clove, some faint sawdust type notes. Theres a very faint presence of vanilla here. Kind of reminds me of a nose like apple cinnamon oatmeal. Mildly earthy, mildly sweet, mildly fruity, mildly musty. Overall, mild everything.

**Taste:** Very sweet but also very thin mouthfeel. Not surprising for the proof. Apples, pears, vanilla. My notes say sweet twice because, well, it is sweet. Kind of a thin, sweet, apple bomb. Mild cinnamon.

**Finish:** Mildly spicy here, like cinnamon or clove. The finishing in new oak really does impart some extra body but its odd it really only seems to show up here and there. Still lots of apple. Short finish, no heat.

**Overall:** Overall, like all other Glenfiddich, this is perfectly fine. Its not bad. Its not amazing. But, it doesnt really have to be. Glenfiddich has made it clear over the years that they are perfectly okay with just being fine. This holds up to that standard nicely. I like it a hair more than the 12, the finishing does give some nice nuance, but I wouldnt say its any better of a product. Rank 5.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
