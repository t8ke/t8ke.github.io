[**Review #154 | Bourbon Review #87 - Four Roses OESF Single Barrel Limited Edition 2014 **]( https://t8ke.review/review-154-four-roses-single-barrel-limited-edition-2014-oesf/)

**The Schtick:** This is an annual release from Four Roses that showcases a single recipe. It is bottled at cask strength.

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses 

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 53.9% ABV

**Age:** 11 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Brown sugar, mild rye spice. Molasses, some clove and this odd fruity hint - like banana and apple. 

**Taste:** Only mildly with an interesting punch to it. It almost drinks a hair more like a rye given the spicey. Theres a hint of metallic edge here. Based on the nose, I expected tons of sweetness here but all Im getting is a dry, rye mouthfeel with some odd metal. Its good, but deceptive. 

**Finish:** Its long, hot and spicy. Growing bitter with only a small hint of maple.  

**Overall:** Ive never branched out and tried all of the 4R recipes but Im starting to see that there can be some major differences. I think, perhaps, this recipe just isnt for me. It was spicier and lacking in the maple and molasses department compared to the nose. I would almost equate it more to a rye. Maybe my palate was off. Either way, I enjoyed getting the opportunity to try this and Ill look forward to snagging some other recipes to venture into in the future.

Thanks for reading!
