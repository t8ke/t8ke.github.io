**The Schtick:** This is a well aged, oloroso matured expression from The GlenDronach in the form of a single cask. It was bottled at cask strength and did not receive and filtering or coloring. 

-----

**Distiller:** GlenDronach

**Bottler:** GlenDronach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 56.9% ABV

**Age:** 19 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Huge, rich, toffee. Cocoa and tobacco. Stewed fruits: currants, blackberry, fig, dates and cranberry. Brown sugar, maple and sweet honey. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich mouth feel. Some heat, though. Lots of honey, toffee, caramel and tobacco. Sulfur sort of storms in, as does the fruity notes like fig, berry and some cherry. Lots of spice, though.

**Finish:** Long, earthy and growing more peppery. Some fruity, lots of pepper and sulfur. 

**Overall:** Again, GlenDronach manages to perform well with a very intense single cask. This one had a bit too much pepper + sulfur in the finish for me, which stopped it from reaching as high as some other casks, but still a great showing. Hard to go wrong with these if you have the coin. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
