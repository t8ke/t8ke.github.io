[**Review #439 | Italian Brandy Review #6 - Villa Zarri 24 Year Old Single Cask Cask Strength Italian Brandy**]( https://t8ke.review/review-439-villa-zarri-24yo-1991-single-cask-kl/)

**The Schtick:** This is a single cask Italian brandy bottled at 24 years old and also bottled at cask strength. Punching in at 59.7%, this should be an interesting look at barrel proof brandy, with some decent age on it.

**Distiller:** Villa Zarri 

**Bottler:** Villa Zarri

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:** 59.7% ABV

**Age:** 24 Years

**Nose:**  Really nice nose, lots of oak, clove, baking spices, vanilla, toffee, and some fruits like fig, plums, apples and a bit of melon. The melon is weird - its not big or dominant, but its an interesting undertone with the other fruits and sweeter notes. Lots of toffee and a hint of ethanol, which isnt surprising, given the proof.  

**Taste:** Rich, thick, and oily. Theres a little heat but its well restrained. Theres lots of caramel here and some tannins and oak. Then the big fruit kicks in - raspberry, blackberry, figs, plums, some pear. Its nicely balanced and the oak and tannins here make for a nice balance that isnt too sweet. 

**Finish:** Very long, mild heat, but thick and complex. Theres so much going on even afterwards, the fruit, clove and cocoa stick around for what seems to be a long time.

**Overall:** I think this was a great pickup and Im glad to be branching out a bit. This is delicious, complex and nuanced and I think it works great in a variety of ways. I even made a brandy old fashioned with this and it was really quite nice. I dont know how much that speaks to the cask selection on KLs part, or the quality base spirit, but Id like to guess that its both. 

Thanks for reading!
