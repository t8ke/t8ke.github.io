[**Review #503 | Bourbon Review #286 - Eagle Rare 10yr Discount Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-503-eagle-rare-10yr-discount-pick-2017/)

**The Schtick:** This is a local store pick, from Discount Liquors in Wisconsin. Eagle Rare 10 year is often a well priced, well aged, solid product. Its one of my go tos and trying store picks is always an activity of interest to me. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** Discount Liquor

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet honey, caramel. Loads of vanilla and butter cream. Theres some nice allspice, and a little bit of guava/passionfruit. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich, super fruity here which blends very nicely with some oak. Theres faint melon, vanilla and caramel. The balance is really striking - fruity and sweet one moment and then the spice and oak balance in the next. 

**Finish:** Medium with lots of maple. 

**Overall:** This is a really unique pick and one I enjoyed thoroughly. Some recent ER10 picks Ive tried were heavy on the oak but this is balanced very well. Its been one of my favorite that Ive tried so far this year.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
