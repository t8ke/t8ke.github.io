[**Review #355 | Scotch Review #355 - Johnnie Walker Blue Label**]( https://t8ke.review/review-355-johnnie-walker-blue-label/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Johnnie Walker

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Vanilla, caramel, some grainy yeasty dough, very mild and sweet.

**Taste:** Thin, pleasantly sweet. Apples, pears, vanilla, mild caramel and thats.....it. Little bit of wafer cookie - very mild yeasty notes with just a hint of clove or oak. No burn.

**Finish:** Mild, no heat. Sweet, not offensive in any way. Doesnt really stick around.

**Overall:** I know I"m not telling you anything you have not heard before. This is a solid, if completely forgettable dram. Its sweet, pleasant and not punishing in any way, whatsoever. It is the perfect CEO / business class whiskey. You can drink it, feel like hot shit, and not cough trying to swallow it neat. It does what it sets out to do, its just a shame it costs about 5 times what its worth. Im giving this a Rank 5 - there are no major flaws but it is not exciting.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
