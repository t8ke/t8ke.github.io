**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of Tamdhu spirit, done by the Jewish Whisky Companys Single Cask Nation line of expressions. Released in the early summer of 2018, this Tamdhu is 10 years old, and then goes on to spend 8 months in an ex-rye quarter cask. Costing $100, plus shipping, it was a hair steep, but showcased something I expected to encounter very little of in the future.

**Distiller:** Tamdhu

**Bottler:** Single Cask Nation

**Selection:** Single Cask Nation

**ABV:** 57.1% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years

**Nose:**  Bread, rich honey, fresh baked cake and vanilla icing. Sweet caramel and toffee. Super sweet, with faint clove at the end.  

**Taste:** Thick, rich. No real heat. Sweet, bread-y, honey. Caramel, toffee and loads of raisin bread. Really rich. Nice spiciness to balance the sweets. Rich pepper, some clove, cinnamon roll. First sweet, then 

**Finish:** Long, rich and growing a little fruity. Vanilla icing, sweet cream, faint melon. Lots more clove and pepper here with some raisin bread to balance as well. 

**Overall:** Single Cask Nation knocked it out of the park on this one, and reminded me of why I really pay the "SCN Tax" in the first place. Their American whiskey selections have been poor, to great, but the scotch selections not only bring the potential of quality, but unique finishes combined with cask strength offerings. I enjoy Tamdhu pretty heavily as I enjoy the toffee forward, buttery sweet profile but the rye time here really helped expand that profile into something I enjoyed more than I expected. At first, I was concerned that 8 months in rye barrels may be an unnoticeable gimmick, but after working through the bottle, Im very content with just how much effect it had on the Tamdhus profile. Great stuff. 

Thanks for reading!
