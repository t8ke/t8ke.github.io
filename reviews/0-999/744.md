**The Schtick:** This is a 10 year old single cask from Bertrand distillery under the Uberach label. It is bottled at cask strength.

-----

**Distiller:** Bertrand

**Bottler:** Uberach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 51.6% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Strong honey, berries, toffee and dough. Rich wine notes, like a big fruity West Coast pinot. Rich vanilla butter cream, strong caramel backbone. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich with some very faint heat. Caramel and honey are really prominent here with some butter cream and rich sherried fruit notes in the background. There is faint oak and pepper to balance. Overall, it is very sweet on the palate but not cloyingly so. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and the sharp pepper is replaced with a nice tobacco note. Stewed fruits and rich vanilla cream lead us out. 

**Overall:** This is really quite well done. This is what Ive been looking for and I think the age here, as well as the higher proof, does this dram very well. The youth notes from other samples arent present here and the rich backbone of flavors like caramel, stewed fruits and tobacco make this my favorite so far. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
