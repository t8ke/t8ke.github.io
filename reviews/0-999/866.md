[**Review #866 | Scotch Review #291 - The Macallan Edition 1**]( https://t8ke.review/review-866-the-macallan-edition-no-1/)

**The Schtick:** I have previously reviewed one of the Macallan Editions (Edition #2) but decided that a side by side of all of the editions to date would be more fulfilling (and also more fun). This is the first of the Macallan Edition releases: Edition 1.

-----

**Distiller:** Macallan

**Bottler:** Macallan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  48% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Musty tobacco, sweet bread-y cake. Sherry, pungent syrupy raisins. Vanilla bean. Really rich, lots of depth, but all sweet + bread-y. No spice, or overbearing oak.    

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No heat. Some bitterness. Sweet sherry, mostly reminiscent of PX sherry. Raisin bread. Interesting plastic note. Figs, syrupy date fruit, vanilla cream, leather and tobacco. 

**Finish:** Medium length, some growing heat here. Growing more spicy / musty. Lots of pepper, tobacco, rich oak tannins. Faint sherry sweetness, but much diminished compared to the nose. 

**Overall:** I enjoyed this but could have done without the plastic-y astringency on the palate. The evolution from nose to finish was fascinating but I ultimately found it to head in a direction that didnt pair well with the plastic notes and a lack of sherry in the finish.

Thanks for reading!
