[**Review #850 | Bourbon Review #454 - Knox Whiskey Works 70/30 Single Barrel MC"s Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-850-knox-whiskey-workd-70-30-single-barrel-mcs-selection/)

**The Schtick:** This is a single barrel release of Knox Whiskey Works 5 year old spirit, distilled using a 70/30 corn:rye mash bill. It is bottled at cask strength and sourced from an undisclosed source. There is very little information out there regarding their contract producer / sourcer, and the mash bill further kicks up the intrigue factor. 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Knox Whiskey Works

**Selection:** MCs

**ABV:** 60.56% ABV

**Age:** 5 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Apples, clove, caramel, tobacco, musty, pepper. Pretty familiar, not super complicated, but also not super off-putting. 

**Taste:** Thin, sweet banana, apples, pears. Sawdust, very hot. Oaky, faint pepper, astringent. 

**Finish:** Short, hot, musty. Wet cardboard, pepper, searing heat. Astringent. 

**Overall:** Not good, and not particularly well sourced. Very hot, even for the proof, with a strong presence of youth and under maturation. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
