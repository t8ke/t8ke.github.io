[**Review #113 | Bourbon Review #63 - High West Campfire**]( https://t8ke.review/review-113-high-west-campfire/)

**The Schtick:** This is a blend of bourbon, rye and peated malt from High West in Park City, Utah.  

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** High West

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Its sweet like bourbon with a mild smokey undertone. Vanilla, then smoke. Molasses, then smoke. On and on. 

**Taste:** This is a funky dram, its sweet and hits all the bourbon notes and then smoke rolls in. I like it a lot, because its not too overwhelming in one way or another. Lots of vanilla, molasses, cinnamon, smoke and a hint of icing. 

**Finish:** Its not wildly long, but its not short or harsh. High West knows what they are doing. 

**Overall:** Its funky. I like it. I want more of it. I might give this bottle a second look someday. Very unique. Points for creativity. 

Thanks for reading!
