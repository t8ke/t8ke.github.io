**The Schtick:** This was sent to me by WhiskeyOnAFencepost. I sampled, posted my notes live in the Discord server and got the reveal from him. It was a total blast, I enjoyed it the night of my recently passed birthday, and I love doing mysteries. Based on his reveal, Ive filled in all of the pertinent info below. 

-----

**Distiller:** Van Winkle

**Bottler:** Van Winkle

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  53% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**   Allspice, clove, caramel and toffee. I believe this to be an American Whiskey. The toffee is really prominent, as is a whole lot of clove. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel. Weirdly sweet. Oranges, vanilla, lemon lime. Seems almost too sweet to be a straight spirit, but its not syrupy so Im just going to assume its a straight whiskey. Theres clove, allspice, faint rubber and faint astringency. This may be faintly peated, but I think its just the astringency. Still an American Whiskey. 

**Finish:** Some oak present. This dram isnt modern, guessing its old, especially based on the weird cloying fruit notes and a blend of astringency. 

**Overall:** It seems too sweet at first but it settles down. Oak is present. Im guessing this is a mid 90s bourbon with a higher rye mashbill and bottled at an ABV between 45% and 50%.

Thanks for reading!
