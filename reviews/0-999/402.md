**Nose:**  Yeasty dough, toffee, vanilla, caramel, black pepper. Lemon poppyseed, burning tire (mild), some cocoa.  

**Taste:** Smoke is here in spades despite being relatively absent on the nose. Sweet and toffee like. Thick, rich mouthfeel. Caramel, black pepper, mild salinity, oaky tannins. Delightful. This is really great. Its sweet and dessert like initially and then transforms to a lovely smokey, peppery show.  

**Finish:** Long and smoky, no heat, deliciously peppery, some cocoa. 

**Overall:** This is the definition of refined smoke. The flavors play incredibly well and are delightful. I love everything about it and Im giving it a high rating to match. 

Thanks for reading!
