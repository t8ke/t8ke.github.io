[**Review #162 | Scotch Review #65 - Aberlour 12yr Non-Chill Filtered**]( https://t8ke.review/review-162-aberlour-12-ncf/)

**The Schtick:** This is a release in Aberlours age stated range that is fully sherry matured, but not chill filtered.

-----

**Distiller:** Aberlour

**Bottler:** Aberlour

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sherry fruit and a hint of baking spice. Lots of plum and raisin. Mildly fudgy with some nice chocolate notes. Grapes and syrupy sweetness. Some clove and allspice to round it out. 

**Taste:** Grapes, sherry, fudge and vanilla. Its delicious and sweet, with a strong leaning in the fudgy fruity direction. I think its a good deal like Macallan 12 but with a little thinner mouth feel and a hair less plum and cocoa.

**Finish:**  Medium and a tad hot, but extra time sitting in the glass beyond my usual 10-15 minutes seemed to quell this. Its very sweet and theres a lot more fruit and spice here with a little less emphasis on the fudge. 

**Overall:** Macallan around me is climbing to absurd price levels. This seems to be about $10 or so dollars cheaper and for that compromise, its totally worth it. I think I still prefer Macallan 12 a tiny bit more, and Im sure Ill be burned alive for that opinion but hey, its what I like. That being said, Ill gladly pick this over the M12 any day because its delicious and full bodied and comes with a lower pricetag and a bit more oomph in the ABV department. 

Thanks for reading!
