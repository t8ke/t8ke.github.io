[**Review #259 | Bourbon Review #143 - Bella Meade XO Cognac Finished Bourbon**]( https://t8ke.review/review-259-belle-meade-xo-cognac-finished/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Greenbrier

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 45.2% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Clove, cinnamon, odd raisen notes, oak, and a good bit of MGP bourbon baking spices and honey. As hard as the finish may try, it cant hide that this is MGP bourbon.

**Taste:** Thin, sweet and definitely a finished MGP. Theres some nice wood spice, wine notes like grapes and honey blend well. Its oddly tannic though and dusty leathery. I like it so far, but more proof would be nice.

**Finish:** Short, grows astringent, spicy, clove heavy

**Overall:** As hard as I try, I think that MGP bourbon just doesnt scratch any itches for me. This is fine, and I enjoyed this product fine but it didnt blow me away or even really leave me feeling a need to try it again. Maybe the finish just isnt for me but my guess is finishing a base spirit I dont totally love wont have spectacular results. Its a good, solid product though if a bit expensive. Im giving this a Rank 5.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
