[**Review #900 | Bourbon Review #471 - Russells Reserve 2002**]( https://t8ke.review/review-900-russells-reserve-2002/)

**The Schtick:** This is a limited edition release from Wild Turkey that is focusing on trying to create a blend of barrels that could top Russells Reserve 1998.

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 57.3% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Oak, pepper, honey, lemon, orange peel, toffee. Faint musty tobacco. Faint clove. Very fruit forward, sweetness and oak are on the back burner.

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, a bit more heat than Id like. Oak, pepper, clove. Some sweetness. Orange peel, faint caramel. Mild cocoa. None of those older, rich delectable musty tobacco notes I get in thinks like Pewter, Split Label and those old decanters. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length. Surprising amount of heat. Oak, pepper, clove, musty tobacco. Not a lot of sweetness here, doesnt stick around for a long time. Dry, bittering oak. 

**Overall:** I have to admit, Im a little disappointed in this. Its oaky, dry, a bit thinner on the palate than Id like and also a bit hotter than I think it should be. The citrus peel is there, that musty Turkey tobacco is super faint and found in the finish only, but honestly, Id take the vast majority of Russells Reserve Single Barrel bourbon and rye selections Ive had over this, and if I had to choose, Id put this on par with WT101. 

Thanks for reading!
