**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Arran

**Bottler:** Arran

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Doughy and light pepper. raspberry jam and strawberry, some mild mild char and some nice vanilla custard notes. Really nice so far.

**Taste:** Fruity and sweet - creamy and loaded with custard. Strawberry and raspberry still throw themselves around quite cavalier like. If this was Parks and Rec, I could scream "Youve just been jammed" and it would hold true. I like this far more than the Pendaryn Madeira. More balance and less artificial sweetness.

**Finish:** Medium and sweet. Fruity and more balanced here with some more clove and some faint char also present.

**Overall:** This is my first brush with Arran whiskey and I have to admit I have no idea about the history or heritage of the distillery but Im loving the product so far. Madeira is one of my favorite finishes and it really shines here. It has all the notes that I personally enjoy and I feel like the spirit is really solid. For those reasons, Im granting this dram a 7 - and up in Rank 7 Arran Madeira Cask gets to sit with other big boys like Sherry Finished Mortlach 16yr Signatory, GlenDronach CS and Springbank 12 Cask Strength. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
