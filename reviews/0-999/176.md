**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Compass Box 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Waxy citrus and lemon peel. Smells like a Glade Plugin, vanilla and pepper and grapefruit follow. Its very delicate, leans towards the fruity but has some weird waxy fruit notes in there also. 

**Taste:** Light and floral. Its like a bouquet of apples and lemon and pear. Vanilla and light cream. Thin mouth feel with no burn.  

**Finish:** Short and waxy but light and gentle. Mild pepper and a good deal of lemon.  

**Overall:** Theres not a ton to say, but there is no reason to over embellish. This is a good dram, its tasty and light. The temperature here is well over 90 and I feel comfortable sipping this on my porch while I sit and relax. Its also very well priced - I picked up this bottle before the new year at $37. Cant complain about that. For this reason, the Compass Box Great King Street Artists Blend squarely earns a 5 rating as a solid, no frills every day dram. The quality is right and there are no flaws that I really feel the need to criticize so it fits nicely in the median. Here, the CBGKSAB (wow thats an acronym) sits comfortably with other peers such as Balvenie 12yr DoubleWood, Johnnie Walker Black, Hibiki Harmony and Glenlivet 12. Thanks for reading!

Thanks for reading!
