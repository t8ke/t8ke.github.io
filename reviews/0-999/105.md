[**Review #105 | Bourbon Review #59 - High West Yippie-Ki-Yay**]( https://t8ke.review/review-105-high-west-yippie-ki-yay/)

**The Schtick:** This is a rye product from High West in Park City, Utah that is finished in Vermouth and Syrah barrels.  

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** High West

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Fruity, very vermouth forward with some spice and vanilla. Mild minty.

**Taste:** The vermouth immediately makes itself know. Theres mint, clove, dill and a good amount of what tastes like menthol minty finish. Its odd. At first I was put off by it but its slowly becoming very pleasant. Good mouthfeel and not hot at all. Really syrupy and overpowering in the vermouth/syrah department, though. 

**Finish:** Medium and spicy but in a good way. Not hot or astringent. Vermouth is still very much present. Lots of clove and some mild allspice in the finish as well.

**Overall:** I knew I was excited for this dram but I had zero expectation of what to really look forward to. It took some warming up to, but its a unique finish and not all together terrible. Expensive and hard to snag, sure, but oddly delicious when the mood is there. 

Thanks for reading!
