**Distiller:** Hiram Walker

**Bottler:** Hiram Walker

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 55.8% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years

**Nose:**  Pepper, floral fruits. Vanilla, caramel, rye spice. Toffee, earthy richness. Floral and herbal, sort of like THH, but definitely closer to   

**Taste:** ich caramel and toffee. Earthy rye. Hot and peppery. Some mineral quality, big bold fruitiness. 

**Finish:** Long and rich. Lots of pepper and caramel candies. Really pleasant. 

**Overall:** This is great and easily the best product Ive had from Canada, especially in the rye department. It is high quality but doesnt really challenge THH or some really good WhistlePig barrels, but that still puts that pretty high on my list of ryes. Its nice to see this come to market and hopefully a future annual release will see some stateside distribution. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
