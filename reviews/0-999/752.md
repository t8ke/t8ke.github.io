**The Schtick:** W. H. Harrison Governors Reserve celebrates the rare balance of boldness and smoothness required in a great leader, and great Bourbon.

**Distiller:** Tipton Spirits

**Bottler:** Tipton Spirits

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 57.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Ethanol, corn, honey and graham cracker. Sweet buttered popcorn and clove. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, some heat. Weirdly thin, lots of honey and faint pepper. 

**Finish:** Short, hot and loaded with fruitiness. Lots of melon, passion fruit, honey, clove and graham cracker. Surprisingly not full of craft notes - which is excellent. 

**Overall:** I wanted to like this more than I did, but it is a bit rough around the edges. Thankfully though, it does not pack a lot of gross young crafty notes which helps it at ranking time. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
