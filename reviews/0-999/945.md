**Distiller:** Highland Park 

**Bottler:** Highland Park 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, confectioners sugar. Some musty grain, bright citrus, faint sweetness. Light smoke, but very faint. Very sweet, very dessert like. Maybe some lemon zest in here. 

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel. No real heat. Sweet cream, honey, lemon zest and faint ashy smoke. Fainy brininess. Overall, it isnt super bold on the palate. 

**Finish:** Short, no real heat. Some honey, much larger ash presence here, and then its gone.  

**Overall:** There is nothing bad about this whiskey, but its also not really there, either. Everything is faint, and the finish is almost non-existent. All in all, its a faint, young Highland Park, which unfortunately suffers from lack of age and proof. 

Thanks for reading!
