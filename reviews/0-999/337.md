**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Westland

**Bottler:** Westland

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 56.2% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Really funky - smells more like a bourbon. Cinnamon, maple, brown sugar, cloves, some floral fruity sweetness.

**Taste:** Much better mouthfeel, although still a hair thin for the proof. Almost a little smokey peaty, overripe fruit, some fleeting sweetness. Its kind of all over the place. Wet cardboard, some lemon zest. The smokey hint comes and goes. The different malts make their appearances but not very well integrated. The peated malt also kind of stomps over the other more delicate flavors.

**Finish:** Short - not much there again. Smoke is dominant over just about every note.

**Overall:** Okay, this is getting better. Weve got more flavor, a little more solid finish (although still not great) and there is some complexity to be spoken of. It appears this one is quite a bit of work to hunt down, but I dont understand the appeal. Ill give this a Rank 5 - big improvement on the previous and Id drink it if someone handed me a dram. This may sound overly negative but were getting closer to a whiskey I can get excited about.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
