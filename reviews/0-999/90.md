**The Schtick:** Glengoyne labels themselves as an "unhurried" producer. I hurried right past that marketing jargon to taste this. This is a 12yr expression from Glengoynes core range, which is more or less viewed by many as budget sherry territory. 

-----

**Distiller:** Glengoyne

**Bottler:** Glengoyne

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years

**Nose:**  Honey, lots of sweet fruit, namely pears and apple. Theres some malty sweetness and more honey and apple. The label lauds some coconut but I fail to pick up on this. I for one, am glad. 

**Taste:** Sweet with a little ethanol zip. Theres honey, apples and some more fruit with a tiny bit of grape sweetness. Its like a Juicy Juice Lite for big kids. 

**Finish:** Medium and guess what...fruity. Its not bad, a little hot and thin but overall not bad. 

**Overall:** To me, this screamed poorly done Aberlor 12. If this were a blind, I know thatd be my response. Overall, its a relatively well made dram that doesnt try too hard. 

Thanks for reading!
