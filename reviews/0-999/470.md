**The Schtick:** This is the final phase of Gobble Til You Wobble and Ill be looking at both the Bourbon and Ryes that are sold under that line. Bourbons first, ryes second. This is a modern offering from Wild Turkey with the higher entry proof. It is diluted to 104 pf and sold as a single barrel offering across the nation. Many stores have been able to do picks of these products, and extra information is available as a result. It is, still, a NAS product, though.

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** Liquor Barn

**ABV:**  52% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich nougat, caramel, vanilla and buttercream. Honey, gingerbread, pepper and some oak. Creamy caramel. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich, mild heat. Honey, gingerbread, oakiness. Pepper, faint lemon zest and some nice caramel. 

**Finish:** Sweet, but short with mild heat. Theres a lot more oak here and although theres a good sweet component, its a little dry for my tastes. 

**Overall:** I really enjoyed this pick as well, but unfortunately, it was a little on the dry side for me. I have a feeling this would make a wicked cocktail. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
