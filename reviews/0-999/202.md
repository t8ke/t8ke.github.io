**Nose:**  Orange, ginger, sweet sugar. Smells like a candy shop.                                                                                                                                                                                  +
Orange and ginger, some rye spice and a good deal of sugar again. The rye spice is a welcome visitor though, and although it doesnt fully balance it does bring some nice contention to the all sugar and orange nose of the original.  

**Taste:** Thin syrupy mouth feel. Lots orange, ginger, cough syrup, some juniper and lime. Its really strange. Definitely a cocktail in a jar. Very little, if any, rye character to speak of.                                                       +
Thicker, more viscous mouth feel. More orange, a bit of heat and some clove, cinnamon, lime and gingerbread. Sweet is the name of the game here though and some icing and citrusy sugar spring back to cover up all of that rye goodness.  

**Finish:** Short but exceedingly mild in the heat department. Lots of sweet orange notes with some odd lime in there too. I wonder if thats just the result of the citrus+sugar overload.                                                                                                                                 +
Medium and more "full". A bit more going on with more rye spice back to round things out. Ironically the finish really improves here. It becomes dryer and exhibits more rye characteristics as it fades on. This is one of the few drams I can remember that I can likely say were "saved by the finish."     

**Overall:** I think it makes a great mixer. It wont overtake a straight whiskey anytime soon but for a hot day summer cocktail, I can see this going very well with a big ice cube and a splash of soda water or tonic. Its thin though and on its own its just all over the place. Cloyingly sweet and all sugar with very little apparent whiskey character. For this reason, Im giving it a 4. Its okay, but not something Id want to have all of the time or more than one of in an evening.                                                                          +
This is surprisingly likable. Its inexpensive ($25.99 here), flavorful and just interesting and different enough that, when combined with the price, deserves to be bought and tried once. Its kinda fun and trying to make new cocktails with it has proved to be interesting also. Its not crazy good but it definitely fixes a good deal of the flaws I disliked in the original. For this reason Ill rate it a 5. Its interesting, not terrible and an interesting look into what can be done when you highwest some flavors together. Thanks for reading!
