[**Review #541 | Rum Review #14 - Koloa Kauai Dark Rum**]( https://t8ke.review/review-541-koloa-dark-rum/)

**The Schtick:** This is a dark rum produced and bottled by the Koloa rum company in Hawaii. No official info on dosing / sweetening / dyeing. This is dark af, though, which gives me some inklings of an answer.

**Distiller:** Kaloa

**Bottler:** Kaloa

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Caramel, confectioners sugar, brown sugar. Faintly under ripe fruits but its wildly, syrupy sweet.

**Taste:** Thin. No heat. Tastes like hot fudge. I shit you not. Tastes like the artificial fudge topping of a McDonalds $1 sundae. Other than that, there is a lot of cocoa, confectioners sugar and a little banana funk. I think this is clearly sweetened. 

**Finish:** Short, loads more cocoa. No heat whatsoever.

**Overall:** This is really weirdly strange. Its not really like rum at all. Tastes like a fudge explosion which is completely new coming from a rum in my perspective. I think its a clear that this rum is neither 100% natural in color or profile. 3/10 for straight weirdness

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
