**Nose:**  Honey, caramel, toffee, faint fruitiness, creme brulee.  

**Taste:** Thick, rich, dessert-y. Vanilla, honey, caramel. Oak, pepper, rich tobacco. Faint passion fruit. 

**Finish:** Short to medium. No heat. Sweet creme brulee. Caramel, vanilla, faint cocoa. 

**Overall:** Surprisingly, this is complex, sweet and delicious. Tasted blind, Im certain I would not have pinned this for a grain product. I enjoyed it very much.
