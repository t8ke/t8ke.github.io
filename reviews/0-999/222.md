**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Glenlivet

**Bottler:** Glenlivet

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 64.6% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Huge toffee, plum, grapes, syrupy sherry and vanilla cream. Id bet money that this is PX given the usual suspects in the nose. It smells syrupy and rich.

**Taste:** Thick and oily. Probably a result of the mammoth proof. Lots of sweetness here, syrupy again with the raspberry, plum, date fruit, grapes and vanilla cream. Real big helping of toffee and caramel also. Theres some heat but I expected far worse from a relatively young dram at almost 130 proof.

**Finish:** Long and rich - the cream balances out the intense, syrupy, fruitiness of the nose and palate and caramel, nougat and cocoa really show.

**Overall:** Very rarely does Signatory disappoint me and this only adds to their clout in my mind. This dram is thick and heavy, strong and full bodied. For well under $100 this is a great bottle to own. Its really cool to see the Glenlivet spirit shine in a different light under conditions wed likely never see from the original distiller. I have yet to try the sherried Nadurra releases but Ill wait to hold judgement on those until I do. For now though, Im scoring this dram a lofty 7. I wavered for a long time between a 6 and a 7 but theres so much richness in this dram and it punches well above its pricetag and age so Im going to give it the benefit of the doubt. A 7 it is. This puts it near another one of my favorite Signatorys - the Tamdhu 10yr FF Sherry as well as a lot of other OB expressions Ive come to love like Glendronach CS, Glenfarclas 105, This is Not a Luxury Whiskey and more.

Thanks for reading!
