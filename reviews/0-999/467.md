**The Schtick:** This is the final phase of Gobble Til You Wobble and Ill be looking at both the Bourbon and Ryes that are sold under that line. Bourbons first, ryes second. This is a modern offering from Wild Turkey with the higher entry proof. It is diluted to 104 pf and sold as a single barrel offering across the nation. Many stores have been able to do picks of these products, and extra information is available as a result. It is, still, a NAS product, though.

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** Liquor Barn

**ABV:**  52% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Sweet buttercream. Vanilla is really prominent here with toffee, caramel and butterscotch. Fruity, absurdly enough its almost like strawberry shortcake. Cloves, allspice and more caramel. Its sweet, fruity and well balanced. 

**Taste:** Really rich mouthfeel. Sweet caramel, butterscotch and caramel apples. Theres also some pear, some strawberry and some nice cocoa and allspice. I didnt know I needed this in my life until it hit my taste buds. Im really digging the blend of sweet, the fruity and the nice spicey baking notes to round out. 

**Finish:** Long, with faint heat. Huge caramel and fruitiness. Impressively complex - everything from the palate is here and smolders on out. 

**Overall:** Really pretty phenomenal. Im going to rate this the same as some of my favorite WhistlePig single barrels and THH. This really rounds out the variety of profiles I love in rye. I may not pick it everyday based on the profile I want, but if I want sweet, fruity, spicy dessert rye - this is the ticket. 

Thanks for reading!
