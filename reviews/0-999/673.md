[**Review #673 | Rum Review #18 - Pussers 15yr Rum**]( https://t8ke.review/review-673-pussers-15yr-rum/)

**The Schtick:** Supposedly a special blend of 5 West Indies rum in the ol Royal Navy days - this modern expression is a blend of 5 rums, aged for 15 years that are sourced from Guyana and Trinidad.

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Pussers

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Sticky rum cake, overripe banana, guava, toffee, lime, faint oak.

**Taste:** Medium, no heat. Sweet, toffee, maple syrup, overripe fruit, honeydew, cocoa, milk chocolate

**Finish:** Medium no heat syrupy maple, brown sugar, molasses, overripe banana 

**Overall:** This is fine but unremarkable. Its a bit sweet, I think they went a hair overboard dosing, but the flavors are nice and the mouth feel is rich. I need to try other Pussers expressions but I bet an increase in proof would really help here.  

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
