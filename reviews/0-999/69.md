[**Review #69 | Bourbon Review #39 - Stagg Jr. Batch 3**]( https://t8ke.review/review-69-stagg-jr-batch-3/)

**The Schtick:** Stagg Jr is made from the same mashbill as the Buffalo Trace Antique Collections George T. Stagg product. This is aged "almost ten years" per the label and is bottled at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 66.05% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Even more vanilla and theres something new here...cherries. With it comes a bit more clove and chocolate. 

**Taste:** Much sweeter than previous batches. Vanilla abounds, and theres almost a creamy custard like sweetness. Lots of cherry too. 

**Finish:** Longer again, much like Batch 1 without the napalm. Its still hot, yes, but it seems proportional to the proof and theres tons of flavor here. Significant balance not seen quite yet.

**Overall:** This is a significant improvement over the first two batches. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
