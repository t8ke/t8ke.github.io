**The Schtick:** This was a mystery sample sent to me by /u/ethanized. I tasted it, took notes, and then messaged them to him for reveal. I got a little caught up in trying to guess and forgot to think of a 1-10 score, so for these I decided to simplify things into one of five categories:

-----

**Distiller:** Anchor Distillery

**Bottler:** Anchor Distillery

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:** 55.3% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Green craft make notes. Pine, wet cardboard. Caramel, toffee. This is definitely not scotch. Unmistakably young, green, and loaded with craft American Whiskey notes.  

**Taste:** Green craft notes. Piney, juniper, almost a gaint gin profile. Heat - its hot. Thicker fruity, some overripe syrupy citrus fruits. If its not american whiskey its gotta be a weird fuckin rum. 

**Finish:** Surprisingly long but still loaded with crafty notes - pine, crafty wet wood + cardboard. Unpleasant. 

**Overall:** This is weird. My guess is that it is Fuckery bottled at 45% - 50% ABV. Thats really the best I got. Its gotta be something craft, but the new make notes are so powerful they cover up a lot of the character. It bad. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
