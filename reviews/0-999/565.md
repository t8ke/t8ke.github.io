[**Review #565 | Bourbon Review #316 - Four Roses OESO Private Selection Warehouse Selection**]( https://t8ke.review/review-565-four-roses-private-selection-oeso-warehouse-selection/)

**The Schtick:** Four Roses releases single barrels of a specific recipe at cask strength as their private pick program. 

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** Warehouse

**ABV:**  59% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Spicy and hot. Lots of clove, allspice and lots of fruity notes. Really prominent maple and that signature 4R spice. 

**Taste:** Super fruity, loads of melon and strawberry. Also lots of heat. Medium mouthfeel. Backend womps with a lot of cinnamon, allspice and faint caramel. 

**Finish:** Medium length with much more severe heat. Sweet vanilla and some fruity essence set in before more searing ethanol lead it out. 

**Overall:** On one hand I liked that this was a unique profile but it was unbalanced and quite hot. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
