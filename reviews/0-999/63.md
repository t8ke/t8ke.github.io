[**Review #63 | Bourbon Review #33 - Elijah Craig Small Batch 12 yr**]( https://t8ke.review/review-63-elijah-craig-small-batch-12yr/)

**The Schtick:** Heaven Hill recently removed the 12 year age statement from this product. This is the original 12 year age stated release. 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  47% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  More oak, less vanilla and a bit more wood. Much stronger, and theres less artificial sweetener notes.   

**Taste:** More oak, with maple and vanilla in the backseat. Hot, but less noticeable.

**Finish:** Medium long, less hot and less offputting. In general, Ive only really experienced that odd sweetener note in products like MMCS46 but its here a little as well. Im just thankful its not present in ECBP.

**Overall:** Still not my cup of tea. While the change in the NAS was noticeable, neither product are my preferred experience. Too oaky and dry. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
