[**Review #556 | Scotch Review #198 - Tamdhu Batch Strength Batch 1**]( https://t8ke.review/review-556-tamdhu-batch-strength-batch-1/)

**The Schtick:** This is Tamdhu released at cask strength, but without an age statement.

-----

**Distiller:** Tamdhu

**Bottler:** Tamdhu

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 58.8% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Caramel, toffee, very nutty sherry. There is soke fruity essence like fig and blackberry but the nutty peanut brittle is really dominant in a savory sweet way here. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouthfeel -  surprising given the proof. Some heat. Nutty, faintly sour grapes, toffee and caramel. Fruitier than the nose but still clearly very nutty sherry. Nice peanut brittle note here also. 

**Finish:** Medium length with some heat. Sweet toffee. 

**Overall:** I really like this profile but found the palate a bit thin and a bit too much heat throughout. Its a nice unique profile but the heat is really what keeps it from climbing higher. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
