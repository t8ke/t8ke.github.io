[**Review #407 | Bourbon Review #231 - Bulleit Cask Strength Bourbon**]( https://t8ke.review/review-407-bulleit-cask-strength-first-release/)

**The Schtick:** At the time of this writing (March 2017) - this product was a KY exclusive. It has since been re-released with CONUS wide availability.

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Bulleit 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  55% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey and lots of dough here. Sweet corn, a good deal of vanilla and some mild clove. Its really quite nice - really sweet focused with spice taking the backseat.

**Taste:** Rich mouthfeel - the proof does really well here. Reminds me of dessert - cocoa, clove, vanilla and toffee. Theres a little cinnamon kick but nothing like an OWA red hots bomb. There isnt much clove or tannic oak - just a strong focus on everything sweet. A little corn too but even that blends to vanilla in the end.

**Finish:** Long, much more spice here than the nose or palate. Its not overbearing but its here. More sweetness pops back up - makes for a nice blend of this, also.

**Overall:** I didnt know what to expect from this but I really enjoyed it. I havent formally reviewed the standard bottling or the 10yr but now its on my short list to get to. I was pleasantly surprised, for going in blind as far as expectations, I left a fan. Solid quality and it really goes to show what proof, rather than age, can contribute to a bourbon.

Thanks for reading!
