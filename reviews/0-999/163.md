[**Review #163 | Scotch Review #66 - The Glenlivet 12**]( https://t8ke.review/review-163-the-glenlivet-12yr/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Glenlivet

**Bottler:** Glenlivet

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Theres something Ive never been able to place. It always seems to come across much like a jolly rancher. Other than that, theres lemon, apple and pear. A good deal of custard, apple pie and vanilla icing. Its sweet, delicate and fruity with some floral notes to it. To me, it smells like Spring.

**Taste:** Thin green apple, more jolly rancher likeness, vanilla cream and honey dew. I think that flavor is honey dew. Some mild funk. Banana bread and slight nuttiness. 

**Finish:**  Medium and delicate. Sweet, fruity and floral. Its not harsh and Id certainly hope not based on the proof. 

**Overall:** For what I can get this for (~$35) it does a great job of performing. Its light, ideal for patio sipping while I read or just putz about. There are other similar profiles and prices but Im glad I picked this one for the time being. It doesnt blow anything out of the water, but then again, I dont think its meant to. Its a perfect daily sipper. 

Thanks for reading!
