**The Schtick:** Recently, a monster storm rolled in. I took off early from work in the afternoon to be home and enjoy the falling snow and decided it was the perfect afternoon to uncork some of the bigger guns Ive been meaning to review. Snowed in, nowhere to have to go...it was the perfect recipe. Lets dive in!

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 55.1% ABV

**Age:** 16 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Woody, oaky, floral and funky. Loads of vanilla, some caramel. Oddly fruity. Its like a lot of other OESKs Ive had - but the introduction of heavier oak is really curious.

**Taste:** Thick mouthfeel. Pretty rich. Caramel bomb with some oaky backbone. Good heat for the proof. Very floral with some of those fruity undertones as well.

**Finish:** Long, spicy and floral.

**Overall:** This is really good. It affirms my love of the OESK recipe but...its not as good as some others Ive had. This is a refreshing sentiment that shows that age is not the end all, but rather part of the puzzle. The oak was nice but a little heavyhanded and the more delicate floral nuance of the OESK recipe didnt seem to integrate as well as I would have liked. That being said, it was delicious and I enjoyed sampling it very much. Ill give this a Rank 7.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
