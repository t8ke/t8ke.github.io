[**Review #268 | Scotch Review #268 - Laphroaig Lore**]( https://t8ke.review/review-268-laphroaig-lore/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Laphroaig

**Bottler:** Laphroaig

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  48% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Evergreen, vanilla, pound cake, tropical fruits,thin cocoa, definitely laphroaig smokey. Dead sea things, bandaids, some brine.

**Taste:**   Thin mouth feel, feels like the 10yr. Sweet bubblegum, smoke, char, and not much else. I feel like theres a lot of character here but no real intensity.

**Finish:**   Medium, hot and not complex. Smokey vanilla with sweet honey. The smoke is even short lived and doesnt carry like Laphroaig smoke usually does.

**Overall:** Overall, this is disappointing and a shame that they think $120 for this bottle is reasonable or justified. What notes there were, I enjoyed but there was a lack of complexity and boldness which is disappointing , especially for a product marketed to represent the "Lore" of the distillery. Im going to rank this a 5 - its good and fine but no better than the 10 to me. Id take the QC or the Cask Strength any day with no hesitation whatsoever.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
