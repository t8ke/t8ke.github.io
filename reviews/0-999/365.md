**The Schtick:** Produced to commemorate Jimmy Russels 60th Anniversary with Wild Turkey, who started at 1964. It is a blend of 13-16yo whiskey, bottled at 91 proof.

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Wild Turkey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 45.5% ABV

**Age:** 13 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet corn, vanilla, cracked pepper, some ethanol. Mild clove, little bit of old leather.

**Taste:** Thin mouthfeel, sweet vanilla, mild corn notes, some clove here. Some savory cinnamon and a good deal of oak influence. No real heat to speak of. I wish the proof was a hair higher, just for the sake of a richer mouthfeel.

**Finish:** Medium to short, nice and sweet with a good oak backbone.

**Overall:** This is pretty good as far as things go, but I think its underproofed and over oaked. I certainly wouldnt consider this worth the asking MSRP, but as a bourbon out on its own, I dont think its too shabby. Im going to give this a Rank 6 - its good, and definitely a notch above average, but punches no higher.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
