**Distiller:** Bruichladdich

**Bottler:** Bruichladdich

**Selection:** N/A

**Nose:**  First blast of toffee and butterscotch - almost like straight Werthers original candies. This give way to vanilla, some meringue notes and a healthy dose of now apparent jam. Its doughy and sweet with a good deal of strawberry, raspberry and a hint of lemon developing in that jam note. 

**Taste:** Really thick and oily. Coats well and I notice it more here than in the 640. Mild heat (very mild) and some smoke is making its way into the mix. Lots of toffee, caramel, lemon zest and raspberry as well as developing brine. Theres a hint of burning rubber which oddly plays well into the equation. Over all, its complex and well blended with each flavor melding very well with the next. I never thought jam and brine would complement each other, but they absolutely do.   

**Finish:**  Long with mild heat. Sweet and smokey with the rubber note fading to a pleasant char. The custard vanilla and jam make a re-appearance though with more raspberry and faint vanilla lemon drop notes before fading one last time to a long, gentle smokey demise.  

**Overall:** I said I was impressed before with the 640 and this is no different. Its delicious - its sweeter and less jammy and the smoke is a hair more evident here. I like it a lot and like the previous - I wish I had one on hand at all times. Id really like to have the means to crawl deeper down the Bruichladdich rabbit hole. 

Thanks for reading!
