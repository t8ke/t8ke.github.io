[**Review #434 | Armagnac Review #3 - Domaine de Salie 20yr Armagnac **]( https://t8ke.review/review-434-domaine-de-salie-20yr/)

**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Domaine de Salie

**Bottler:** Domaine de Salie 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 48.8% ABV

**Age:** 20 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet fruit, cloves, cocoa and stewed fruits (grape, plums, figs, blackberry) 

**Taste:** Thin mouthfeel but nice and flavorful. No heat. Sweet plums and figs. Theres some light pepper and a nice cocoa touch. 

**Finish:** Short and a little hot for the proof but very sweet and pleasant. Some faint molasses, light sulfur, and a lot of pear. 

**Overall:** I like this but I think its fairly one dimensional - very sweet with little balancing here. The sulfur was an interesting sensation to get in the finish but despite my criticisms, I dont think there were major flaws. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
