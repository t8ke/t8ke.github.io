**The Schtick:** 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet toffee, caramel, dough, light corn syrup note. No hint of heat or astringency. 

**Taste:** Mellow and thin, corn and dough are the two dominant notes here. No toffee and faint sweetness. There is also no sign of heat or proof. Very one dimensional. 

**Finish:**  Sweet and short. Lots of odd astringency here and then the corn and dough return. 

**Overall:** Theres really not much to say here. Its awesome to be able to try this and its really educational to see how things change and compare over time. Has this changed over time comparing new JBWL against this much much older bottling? Certainly. Night and day. Is it any better? No. Its thin, one dimensional and quite frankly just not that good. It seems to fall apart after the nose, which gives the impression of a delicious dram to follow but just cant live up. For this reason, Im scoring this bottle the same as its modern counterpart, who lives at Rank 4. Thanks for reading! In a couple weeks Ill be dropping a huge Dusty roundup. Should be interesting. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
