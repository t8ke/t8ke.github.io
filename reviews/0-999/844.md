[**Review #844 | Bourbon Review #452 - Willett Pot Still**]( https://t8ke.review/review-844-willett-pot-still-bourbon/)

**The Schtick:** This is supposedly a blend of 8-10 year old whiskies, according to murky internet information. The sample I am trying bears the small batch designation, although it once was a single barrel release. It is generally well accepted that this is a sourced product, with more and more of the blend being replaced by Willett produced bourbon as their stocks come of age. I will admit, it is sort of cute, as far as distillery produced and sold miniatures go. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Willett

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  47% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Corn, wet cardboard (mild), vanilla icing, faint clove

**Taste:** Thin, some heat. Corn, vanilla, grass, really not a lot going on here. Maybe faint oak. 

**Finish:** Short, hot. Oaky, faintly musty, some vanilla. Astringent. 

**Overall:** Not a lot going on here, its hot, muted palate paired with a short, astringent finish lands this squarely in multiple flaw territory. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
