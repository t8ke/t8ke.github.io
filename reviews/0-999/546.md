**Nose:**   Root beer barrel candies. Striking resemblance. Caramel, toffee, sassafrass, root beer soda, birch. Faint pepper. 

**Taste:** Sweet, definitely dosed. Thick, rich mouthfeel with minimal heat and funk. Totally resembles a root beer barrel candy, with notes of honey, caramel, sassafrass and maple. 

**Finish:** Short, sweet, no heat. This rum is a root beer float in a barrel. 

**Overall:** I like this but like the dark rum, its obviously sweetened. That said, that sort of thing usually bring out the pitchforks, but this was pretty well done all things considered. This would be the perfect float on a traditional daquiri. Its definitely not a neat sipping rum, though. 

Thanks for reading!
