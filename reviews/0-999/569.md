**The Schtick:** This is a 12 year old store pick done jointly by NASA liquors in Texas and Rosewater. As of right now, it sports some of the cooler labeling that is out there for Knob Creek picks - a custom back graphic and name that describe the pick and where it was selected from. 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** NASA

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, caramelm gingerbread. Tobacco, some oddly floral notes. Overall its a hair muted compared to some other picks Ive had, but still interesting. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich but at the price of some heat. Lots of caramel, cocoa and pepper. Theres faint oak, some vanilla and a continuing, lingering pepper presence. 

**Finish:** Long and rich with the heat more in check here. Lots of caramel with a faint floral fruitiness to it.  

**Overall:** I liked this pick, but of the many picks in this series, a number of them over 12 years old, this isnt my favorite. NASA did another pick, "Rapture" that I found to be superior to this. That being said, it was still an enjoyable dram, if not the best.

Thanks for reading!
