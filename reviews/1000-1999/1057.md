[**Review #1057 | Scotch Review #362 - Glenfiddich Fire and Cane**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1057-glenfiddich-fire-cane/)

**The Schtick:** This is the fourth entry in Glenfiddichs Experimental Series. It takes peated Glenfiddich and matures it in rum casks. 

-----

**Distiller:** Glenfiddich

**Bottler:** Glenfiddich

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Light brine and smoke. Faint ask. Sweet vanilla cream. Molasses. Faint lemon, pear. Caramel. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Faint heat. Sweet molasses, light freshly baked bread. Faint ash, light pepper and smoke. Faint brown sugar. Fun and interesting, but oddly disjointed. 

**Finish:** Short, sweet and bready, with a little rum funk, before pepper, salt and light smoke dash in. 

**Overall:** I like this, its very different. That said, it doesnt blend particularly well. Its fun and interesting, and I really enjoy that, but I dont think its as good as it could be. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
