**The Schtick:** This was distilled in 2007 by the now affected Long Pond Distillery. They lost some barrels in a blaze but otherwise seem fine and should be back to us in a decade or two. I have all four releases in the series to review, and this is day two, so lets keep the party going. 

-----

**Distiller:** Long Pond

**Bottler:** Velier

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 62.5% ABV

**Age:** 11 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Peach, brown sugar. Rotting banana and papaya. Light mango. Plastic and rubber notes. Really interesting, fairly complex with funk showing its power, while not dominating. 

**Taste:** Rich mouth feel. Sweet honey, caramel, papaya and lemon. The heat kicks into gear a bit, as does the funk. Rich burning rubber, light plastic, the rotting fruit is present and unmistakable. Lots of tobacco on the end. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and funky. The fruit has almost completely given way to burning ash, rubbery funk and rotting fruits and leather. Tobacco is here and its really interesting. 

**Overall:** This is powerful, unique and a real treat. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
