**Distiller:** Arran

**Bottler:** Maltman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 18 Years

**Nose:**  Sweet and rich, lots of sulfury sherry. Blckberry and currants are prominent, with a good deal of spice, pepper and orange peel.   

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel with no heat. Sweet, lots of vanilla and bready character here, with a good deal of honey, light sherry and pepper. 

**Finish:** Short and growing hotter. Lots of sulfur here, with bitter pepper. Some light fig and currant persist, but its quickly overwhelmed by other bitter aspects of the dram. 

**Overall:**  I loved how this dram started out but it really faded over time for me. The nose was rich and syrupy with good balance, but by the end it was a bitty sulfur-y dram. 

Thanks for reading!
