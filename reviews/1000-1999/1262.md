-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Smooth Ambler

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 43.8% ABV

**Nose:**  Honey, floral berries, pipe tobacco. Really fruity. Blackberry, vanilla, baking spices and cherry. Some light melon. Nice pepper. No ethanol. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. No heat. Honey, toffee, blackberry and cherry. Light melon. Baking spices, toffee, cinnamon and vanilla bean. Nice, certainly unique. 

**Finish:** Long, mild, lots going on. Strawberry, cream, vanilla, toffee, and caramel. Super fruit. Reminds me of those old Cream Savers hard candies. 

**Overall:** Really delicious. I'd drink this over most other SAOS barrels I've had before. Awesome stuff. 

Thanks for reading!
