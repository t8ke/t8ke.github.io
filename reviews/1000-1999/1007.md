**The Schtick:** This is a release in Old Foresters Vintage dated line of expressions. Called the "Original Batch" this is supposed to harken back to George Browns orignal batching process. It is "minimally filtered" - whatever that means. 

-----

**Distiller:** Brown-Forman

**Bottler:** Brown-Forman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Brown sugar, maple, banana bread. Lightly musty, some definite youth.   

**Taste:** Thin, musty, hot. Theres a lot of heat here, for not a lot of flavor. Some maple, more banana bubble gum notes, faint clove. 

**Finish:** Medium length, heat is better here but a bit too hot still. Oak, pepper, faint clove, some vanilla. 

**Overall:** Not really remarkable. Thinner than I would like, and hotter than I would like, without bringing much flavor to the table. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
