-----

**Distiller:** Bowmore

**Bottler:** Adelphi

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 56.3% ABV

**Age:** 20 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet and pungent. Mossy, sweet honey. Some fig, some blackberry. Faintly musty. Light spearmint, some raspberry. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Some heat, nothing punishing. Honey, musty peat, ash, campfire, blackberry. Lightly syrupy, more peat than sweet. No iodine. Wet mud.

**Finish:** Short to medium in length. Heat restrained. Iodine, syrupy sweetness. Light ash, burning wood, blackberry and plum. 

**Overall:** Probably the best Bowmore Ive had to date. The blend of syrupy fruits, ashy burning wood and well integrated peat notes make this a winner. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
