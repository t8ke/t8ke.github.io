**Distiller:** Mississippi River Distilling

**Bottler:** Mississippi River Distilling 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Nose:**   Huge cinnamon blast. Floral potpourri. Clove, pepper, pipe tobacco. Lots of meaty spice. Really interesting. 

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel. Red hots, oak, woody tannins. Sweet caramel, bitter spices, some juniper. Tastes like I imagine some candles smell. Really heavy on the potpourri spice. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length. Massively cinnamon forward. It almost edges everything else out. 

**Overall:** Overall, this was nice, but very focuses on the red hot note, which hasnt always been my favorite.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
