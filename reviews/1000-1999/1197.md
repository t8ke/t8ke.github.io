**Nose:**   Sticky sweet sherry. Toffee, almond, syrupy stewed fruits. Nutty and fruity, definitely focused on the dessert sherry. Lots of caramel here also. No ethanol, really. 

**Taste:** medium mouth feel. savory and sweet. Honey, honey roasted peanuts, amaretto, sticky stewed fruits. Caramel and toffee. Carmalized sugar. Some sulfur, lots of musty pipe tobacco.

**Finish:** Long, but at the cost of some heat here. Sweet sticky sherry. Stewed fruits. Honey, figs, cherry and currant. Nutty and sweet. Some sulfur here too.

**Overall:** This was pretty good. A bit hot in the finish but a dessert focused sherry explosion throughout. 

Thanks for reading!
