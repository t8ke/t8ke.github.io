**The Schtick:** Compass Box The Spice Tree is a blend of Clynelish, Dailuaine and Teaninich, that is matured, blended and then finished in "hybrid" active casks - delivering more spice according to CB. Let's see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Compass Box

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Fresh pear, honey, apples, melon. Loads of pepper, spice and orange peel. Ethanol. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Some heat Honey, tobacco, orange peel, berry and vanilla. Sharp tang of oak and sulfur. 

**Finish:** Long but hot, oaky, dry and loaded with sulfur. 

**Overall:** Not a fan of this. It is hot, loaded with sulfur and oak, dry and all over the place. Not bad, but needs more complexity and integration to reach higher. 

Thanks for reading!
