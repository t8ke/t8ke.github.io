**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Plantation

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich sweet melon, and banana. Honey, vanilla, toffee. Theres definitely some funk here. Light rubbery notes, faint overripe papaya. No tar or ash, though.  

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel. No real heat. Sweet vanilla, toffee, light melon. Lots of papaya, banana, almost some almond and blackberry. Then the funk sort of meanders in. Light astringency, faint rotting fruits. Lightly meaty. Pretty complex, overall, without bashing you over the head with any one profile. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length, mild heat. Sweet cream, amaretto, bananas and orange zest close out with a lightly estery finish. 

**Overall:** Overall, this is interesting and impressively complex. Its a good look at a balanced rum displaying a variety of characteristics aside from being a nuclear funk bomb. It plays well in a variety of cocktails, as well. I enjoyed this quite a bit, and the value is also up there as well.  

Thanks for reading!
