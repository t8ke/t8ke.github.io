**The Schtick:** This is the highly anticipated re-release of GlenDronachs 15yr sherry matured single malt. Stripped from shelves and discontinued from release for a period of several years due to stock shortages, this expression from The GlenDronach was sorely missed. I tasted this blind against the old GlenDronach 15 thanks to the help of a friend, so lets see how it fares. 

-----

**Distiller:** Glendronach

**Bottler:** Glendronach

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, syrupy, acetobe, figs and baked bread. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, lots of sugar, honey, figs, dates, raspberry, currant and some mild sulphur. 

**Finish:** Medium length in the finish, pretty good overall. More fig here than berry, grows a little mustier, a bit more sulphur. I notice the ethanol most here on the finish, but it's not punishing or anything. 

**Overall:** Overall, this is still a nice dram. Side by side against the 2015, there's no competition, especially blind. Even the color is a giveaway. That said, I'd still probably get one and just one.

Thanks for reading!
