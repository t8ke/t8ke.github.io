**Distiller:** Delord

**Bottler:** Delord

**Selection:** Elixir

**ABV:**  53% ABV

**Age:** 24 Years

**Nose:**  Rich apricot, honey, pears and peach rings. Sweet, effervescent fruity character. Light oak presence, some spice like pepper. Faint toffee, and some sweet white grape notes.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Faint pinprick of heat. Light sulfur, faint astringency. Then a big burst of fruit. Currants, blackberries, rich Dole fruit syrup. Theres grape, melon and pear. Good oak body without becoming dry or tannic. Light cocoa note. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length, the heat has dried up. Grapes and honeydew are prominent here, more stone fruit than blackberry here. Light herbal character, faint cracked pepper. Rich sweet honey. 

**Overall:** This is a really nice cask, but I could have done without the astringency in the palate. Im happy it was pretty isolated, but I also cant shake it. Over a couple of drams, its failed to disappear completely, and thats going to keep it from reaching higher. That said, this is a great dram. It successfully exemplifies a lot of Armagnacs best characteristics without tasting like a bourbon clone on the cheap, or a super juicy distilled Oregon pinot. Im a fan. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
