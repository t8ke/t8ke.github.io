**The Schtick:** This is an OB offering from Glen Garioch. Bottled at cask strength, this release features 15 year spirit matured in sherry casks, and bottled without coloring or filtering. If I'm not mistaken, this is my first Glen Garioch, which I find quite exciting. Lets dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Glen Garioch

**Bottler:** Glen Garioch

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 53.7% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years

**Nose:**  Leather, cocoa, pepper, sulfur and powerful syrupy sherry. Loads of gingerbread and nutmeg as well. Some fruits like raspberry, currant and blackberry. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No real heat. Sweet and nutty. Lots of raisins. Cocoa, toffee, old sherry funk. Tobacco, fresh blackberry jam and loads of jammy dates. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and lovely. The old musty sherry is prominent and delightful. Honey, orange marmalade, blackberry, currants and pipe tobacco.

**Overall:** I think this is my new OB sherry bomb on the market you can actually buy. Great stuff. Reminds me of how amazing the old GlenDronach 15 used to be. 

Thanks for reading!
