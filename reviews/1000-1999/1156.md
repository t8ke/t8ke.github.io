**Nose:**  Sweet salted caramel. Pepper, honey, clove. Red licorice candies. Toffee, hot buttered rum, rich sweetness. Musty pipe tobacco.

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Honey, caramel, some heat. Salted caramel, clove, rich pipe tobacco. Anise and red licorice, blackberry and currant. Nougat candies. 

**Finish:** Long and rich, lots of currant, pipe tobacco, salted caramel and honey. 

**Overall:** Bucking a trend of very bourbon-y armagnacs, this is a great look at some interesting features found in armagnacs from lesser known domaines. 

Thanks for reading!
