**The Schtick:** This is a Willett release of bourbon distilled at Willett Estate. Dumped from barrel 2047 and aged for 6 years, this release was bottled at cask strength. Let's dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Willett

**Bottler:** Willett

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 61.3% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Fruity banana bread, honey, toffee. Fresh baked bread, raisins, lightly herbal. Really desserty and bready for a rye. 

**Taste:** Sweet yeasty donut. Banana. Clove. Brown sugar. Light herbal character. Lots of heat. Some pepper. 

**Finish:** Long, warm but loaded with bread, pepper, clove and molasses. More banana here. 

**Overall:** Really interesting here. I've never gotten this much banana / Juicy Fruit on a rye before. Wild stuff but not my favorite. Certainly not bad, though. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
