**Distiller:** Deanston

**Bottler:** Deanston

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 51.5% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years

**Nose:**   Super rich. Sweet and syrupy, loaded with fig, honey, toffee and nutty sweetness. Impressively syrupy for so short a time in sherry. Pungent pipe tobacco, nutty praline and some cocoa.

**Taste:** Thick mouth feel, light heat. Rich with honey and toffee, lots of nutty sherry notes. Some currant, creme brulee, stewed fruits and blackberry.

**Finish:** Long, rich and sweet. Complex, loaded with candied fruits, blackberry, currant, pipe tobacco and nutty caramel. 

**Overall:**  This was really impressive. Im a big fan, and this may just be my favorite Deanston release to date.

Thanks for reading!
