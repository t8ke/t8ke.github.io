**The Schtick:** This was a bottle that I tried blind at the behest of a friend. I took the notes and then got the reveal. 

-----

**Distiller:** Tormore

**Bottler:** Old Malt Cask

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 28 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Apples, pears, honey. Damp, musty tobacco. Fresh baked bread. Vanilla cream. Light creme brulee presence. Faintly sour fruits, mildly lactic. Brine, maritime air. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No real heat. Nicely ashy - very wood forward, burning trees and pepper. Faint lemon lime. Orange zest. More burning wood, faint astringency but not bitter. Light sweetness, but mostly dominated by the ashy peat smoke.  

**Finish:** Short to medium length, rich and ashy. Some faint tobacco, more dominant wood structure here, long and rich. 

**Overall:** This is an interesting dram in that it is so vibrantly sweet, fruity and almost lactic on the nose, but the palate introduces strong smoke that carries through the dominate the finish. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
