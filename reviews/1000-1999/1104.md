**The Schtick:** This is a 5 year bourbon distilled at Stitzel Weller in Kentucky in 1972. It was bottled in 1977 and represents what is widely agreed upon to be a bygone era in bourbon production. Given that Stitzel Weller is now shuttered from distilling, it has taken a spot on the mantel of famed distilleries, with some of their products sitting at the head of the hype roundtable. Lets see how this one compares:

-----

**Distiller:** Stitzel Weller

**Bottler:** Stitzel Weller

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 5 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Rich toffee, honey, moist tobacco. Old paper. Caramel and pralines. 

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel. No real heat at all. Sweet and rich confectioners sugar, lots of musty caramel. Faintly savory. Praline, musty tobacco. 

**Finish:** Long and rich with lots of honey, marzipan, pipe tobacco and amaretto notes. Good oak presence without being overbearing. 

**Overall:**  Really great dram, and although it cant top other old Stitzel Weller distillate Ive reviewed in the past, this still does a great job reaching up in the rankings. The complexity despite the thin mouth feel and the length and richness of the finish were incredible. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
