**The Schtick:** WhistlePig is a hybrid spirits operation in Vermont that has previously staked its claim on importing rye whiskey from Alberta to age and bottle in Vermont. In the past, Ive bumped into some of their single barrel ryes and found them really enjoyable. In recent months, WhistlePig has made a switch to digging up some older MGP rye stock for their 10 year old single barrel barrel proof rye, as well. As a result, I have set out to try 25 WhistlePig single barrel ryes to get a lay of the land.  They were arranged, poured and blinded by a generous fellow who loves rye as much (or very plausibly more so) than I do. There are one or two non-WhistlePig ryes in here, also, so the stakes are pretty high. All blind, all in. Welcome to the 2019 Ryenaissance.

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 64.4% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet musty caramel. Fresh baked cake. Sweet butter cream. Werthers caramels. Light oak. 

**Taste:** Rich and thick palate. Very little heat. Sweet honey, peanuts, peanut brittle. Salted caramel. Oak and pepper develop, as well as some mild growing heat. Lovely Blend of sweet and savory, giving way to some strong bittering structure. 

**Finish:** Long and rich. Really rich nougat note. Some oak. Peanut brittle. Light pepper and pipe tobacco. Strong baking spices. Heat grows to be very strong in the finish, though. 

**Overall:** This was a really interesting ride, and one I really enjoyed. If the heat were a little tamer, this would be exceptional. 

Thanks for reading!
