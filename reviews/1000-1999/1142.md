-----

**Distiller:** Daniel Bouju

**Bottler:** Daniel Bouju

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Astounding richness. Loads of pepper, jammy fruits, tobacco and cocoa. Tons of currant, raspberry, cherry, grape and blackberry. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich mouth feel, although there is some heat. Blackberry is really prominent, paired with cherry, raspberry, syrupy jam and caramel. Oak is present but not overbearing. Really lovely palate. Strong structure. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and oaky with a strong fruit structure. Brown sugar, blackverry, pipe tobacco and jammy cherry.

**Overall:** Wow, just wow. This continues to impress, really good bottle and one of the few bottles in the last couple years Id feel compelled to rebuy again and again,. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
