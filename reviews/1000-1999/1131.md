[**Review #1131 | Bourbon Review #568 - Bernheim 8yr Wheat Whiskey**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1131-bernheim-7yr-wheat-whiskey/)

**The Schtick:** This is a wheat whiskey distilled at Bernheim. Wheated bourbon are aften placed at the height of the bourbon craze, although wheat whiskeys appear to escape relatively unscathed. 

-----

**Distiller:** Bernheim

**Bottler:** Bernheim

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Soft sweet, lots of honey and caramel. Faint vanilla. Light oak presence. Not too aggressive, but complex and well rounded. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No real heat here, but lots of good flavor. Oak is present but balanced, which pairs nicely with tobacco, vanilla, caramel and light pepper. Really nice complexity.  

**Finish:** Medium to long in length, more sweet than savory here. The oak and tobacco drop off in favor of the vanilla, caramel and some rich nougat here. 

**Overall:** Its been a couple years since Ive tasted this one, but its still a winner in my book. Id take this over OWA/W12 on just about any day, and I love that it can also be found with relative ease. 

Thanks for reading!
