**The Schtick:** This is a 1990  bottling of bourbon distilled by Old Forester, and exported to the Japanese export market. It's an oldie, a definite dusty by todays standard, and from a producer I don't have much dusty experience with, so I'm looking forward to this one. Let's dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Old Forester

**Bottler:** Old Forester

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich oak, honey, toffee. Musty tobacco. Rich and complex - plums, pipe tobacco and nougat are particularly prominent.

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Apples, pears, rich pipe tobacco and caramel. Good bit of oak and vanilla. Mild heat that grows with time.

**Finish:** A bit of heat here. Ethanol, oak, vanilla and sweet cream. Less fruity, more oaky.

**Overall:** The nose on this is sublime. The palate and finish are okay also, but the nose steals the show. I could do with a little less heat in the palate and finish given the proof, but overall, I like this quite a bit.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
