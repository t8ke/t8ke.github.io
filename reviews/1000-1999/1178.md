**The Schtick:** "Make Mine A Double is a Double Album. Because we needed more space, and notes, to shine a light on the expansive promise of American Brandy. It’s a concept album. We think you will like it. It’s adventurous, it’s bold, and each American Brandy volume is singular and individual. The concept - take 2 individual American Brandy barrels - 1x Ex-Bourbon barrel & 1x medium-char New American oak barrel & then uniquely marry blends at different percentages and finish off in different ways to illustrate brandy’s inherent character stretch." - Copper and Kings site. This is Volume 1

**Bottler:** Copper & Kings

**Selection:** N/A

**Nose:**  Honey, cocoa, almond, amaretto, rich oak, some pepper and light vanilla beam. 

**Taste:** Thick and rich, loaded with pepper, oak and honey. Sweet toffee, amaretto, strawberry, and orange peel. The heat is here, but it pairs with a thick mouth feel. 

**Finish:** Medium in length, very mild in heat compared to the palate. Honey, ginger, blackberry, cocoa and oak. 

**Overall:** Really very well done. This is shockingly good, and I'm surprised how much I enjoyed this. if it weren't on end of bin, I'd be buying the rest. Really complex. 

Thanks for reading!
