[**Review #1227 | Scotch Review #420 - Glenrothes Peated Cask**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1227-glenrothes-peated-cask)

**The Schtick:** This is an interesting release from Glenrothes. Containing both 20yr Glenrothes spirit and other Glenrothes  spirit, it is matured in a Laphroaig cask. Since this is a NAS release, it must mean there is quite a bit of young spirit in with the older spirit, otherwise Glenrothes would be stumbling over themselves to age state this.

**Distiller:** Glenrothes

**Bottler:** Glenrothes

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NA 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet, fresh baked bread. Pepper, honey, some iodine. Nice fig and apple note, blending well with an ashiness and dead sea things.

**Taste:** Thin but no heat. More fresh baked bread, honey, apples, and a mild hit of iodine, ash and burning wood. 

**Finish:** Long, no heat again. Sweet, some honey, almond, light pepper. The peat is strongest here, with an ashy iodine heavy finish that lasts a while. 

**Overall:** While interesting, this wasn't particularly great in any way. I appreciate that it was unique, but even when it was deeply discounted locally...I didn't feel a need to pick another up. I think that speaks for itself. I'd try it if you can, but one was good for me. 

Thanks for reading!
