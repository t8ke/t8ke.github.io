**The Schtick:** "Kinahans 10 Year Old Single Malt Irish Whiskey is matured exclusively in ex-bourbon barrels for a minimum of 10 years. After sampling the whiskey cask-by-cask, Kinahans Malt Master selects only those casks which are as mellow, rich and flavorful as the original Kinahans Irish Whiskey produced centuries ago. Once the casks have been selected, the whiskey is bottled at 92 proof without the use of chill-filtration." - Caskers

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Kinahans

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Young, grainy notes. Ethanol. Toffee, currants and vanilla. Light and effervescent. Not a lot here. 

**Taste:** Thin and a bit of heat. Light caramel, faint raisins. Signature Irish peach ring fruitiness. 

**Finish:** Short, not super rich but not as hot as expected in the nose. 

**Overall:** I, more or less, am putting this in a similar camp as the Kavanagh 12 year. This is clearly distillate that is being funneled away from another product line and being bottled here. Its not great - its not terrible...but its not great. Young, thin and generally hotter than it should be for the proof. 

Thanks for reading!
