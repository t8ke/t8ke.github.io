**Nose:**  Incredibly floral and potent. Sweet, cereal notes and rich fruits, Weirdly fruit-loopy. Sweet honey, lavendar, grape, raspberry and lime. Zesty and bright. 

**Taste:** Sweet and loaded with flavor. Honey, confectioners sugar, coconut macaroon. Lime, lemon, pepper and perfume. Vanilla bean and bready sweetness. 

**Finish:** Short but satisfying - loaded with perfume, floral notes and lavendar. Chamomille, vanilla bean, raspberry, lime and grape. Complexity and presence is so unique and interesting. 

**Overall:** Really wild, and totally interesting. I loved this, despite not being a fan of overly perfume heavy drams in the past. This is so much like a green fruit loop cereal flake, and the fruit presence is complex, unique and delightful. Love it. 

Thanks for reading!
