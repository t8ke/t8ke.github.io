[**Review #1224 | Tequila Review #25 - Jose Cuervo Blanco The Rolling Stones Edition**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1224-jose-cuervo-blanco-the-rolling-stones-edition)

**The Schtick:** This is a *slightly* elevated proof tequila from Jose Cuervo released to celebrate the Rolling Stones. To the best of my memory, this was released sometime in 2015. It's been lingering in the cabinet for many moons, as you can tell. Today it dies, so let's see how it is. Let's dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Jose Cuervo

**Bottler:** Jose Cuervo

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** N/A 

-----

**Nose:**  Strong notes of vanilla bean, ethanol, gummy bear candy, light agave and graham cracker. Sounds weird, but pretty typical Jose Cuervo profile, to me. 

**Taste:** Rough - lots of vanilla, ethanol and pepper. Lots of young sweetness, followed by sharp ethanol and pepper. Weird clay note. 

**Finish:** Short, bit of heat, and lots of musty sweetness. 

**Overall:** Not a huge fan, but it's not terrible. Obviously meant to mix, which it does alright at. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
