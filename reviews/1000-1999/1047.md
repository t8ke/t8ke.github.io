**The Schtick:** This is a pot stilled Irish whiskey that is 12 years old. There is very little other info out there on it, other than its  provenance hailing from the Teeling distillery. I have a feeling distillate that didnt work for other products ended up in this expression.

**Distiller:** Teeling

**Bottler:** Teeling

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years

**Nose:**  Peach rings, candy, confectioners sugar. Light, thin, effervescent. Ethanol is definitely present.  

**Taste:** Thin with no heat. Vanilla cream, charcoal bitterness, short overall without a lot going on. Peach ring candy note is here, though. 

**Finish:** Short, vanilla, loaded with a thin astringent note. Some more peach candy. 

**Overall:** This really wasnt good, and unfortunately showcased a lot of flaws. Being sourced, I can tell that whoever distilled this spirit probably expressed some happiness at being able to pawn it off on a different label. Far from the worst Ive ever had, but the youth and astringency were generally off putting, in combination with being wholly unremarkable. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
