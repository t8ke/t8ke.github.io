**The Schtick:** This is an NDP bottling of rye distilled at MGP in Indiana and bottled by Bulleit (Diageo). Its on the young side, and bottled at 45% ABV, but its inexpensive and universally available.

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Bulleit

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Sweet honey, brown sugar. Lightly floral, some clove and baking spice. Mild copper penny note. 

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel. No real heat. Sweet vanilla, caramel and brown sugar. Spicy clove, light minty dill note. 

**Finish:** Short, a bit more heat here. The spice really takes off. Mostly clove and baking spice, faint tobacco. The dill is here in force, though, and it feels a bit hotter than it should. 

**Overall:** Overall, this is an abundant, inexpensive rye that does well enough for itself. Its not incredible, but its also not bad at all. I think this is a great bottle to pick up if you are unsure if youll like MGPs minty rye profile. 

Thanks for reading!
