**The Schtick:** This is a release made from 100% Islay ingredients. Typically, barley is sourced from other providers in Scotland, but this batch comes from Islay. It is peated to 15-25ppm, rather than the standard 55ppm. This is matured for at least 6 years, although it is not on the label, and spends its time maturing in Buffalo Trace ex-bourbon barrels. It is bottled without filtering or coloring. It also gets a nice bump in proof, as well.

**Distiller:** Kilchoman

**Bottler:** Kilchoman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Creamy, vanilla bean, honey. Lots of lemon, lime, melon and a big earthy, soap stone note. Light ethanol, faint caramel. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Light tar, soap stone, and ash. Honey, pepper, tobacco, lime and ashy smoke. 

**Finish:** Medium length, ashy and earthy, filled with minerality. Some melon, nice wood note and some more cracked pepper.  

**Overall:** Really enjoyable, and loaded with complexity. From the sweet creamy notes, to the ashy, mineral forward soap stone and some light fruit character, this is a well structured dram that really does showcase some of the things to like best about Kilchoman. 

Thanks for reading!
