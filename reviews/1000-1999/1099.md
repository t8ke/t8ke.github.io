**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of spirit distilled at the esteemed Jamaican Distillery Worthy Park. It is bottled by Velier and is comprised entirely of 100% pot still rum. Noting a uniquely long fermentation time of 90 days, this should be quite an experience. For reference, the 502 in the title refers to the congener content of this bottling. Lets see how it is.

**Distiller:** Worthy Park

**Bottler:** Velier 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  57% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**   Sweet caramel, banana, amaretto. Less funky than expected, but loaded with character. Incredibly buttery, and rich. Buttery lemon bar, cashew, vanilla bean, light plastic. Definitely some ethanol here.

**Taste:** Rich, and thick. Mild ethanol burn here. Really interesting - tons of banana, honey, caramel, almond and even some dark cocoa. Growing a little more plastic forward, mild funk, even some faint burning wood, lightly smoky. Really delicious. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and mild. Loads of honey, light ash, savory bbq and some amaretto sweetness. 

**Overall:** I didnt know what to expect from this going in, but now I regret having a sample and not a bottle. This was really something, and I bet the cogeners would absolutely tear things up (in a good way) in cocktail land, as well. Well done with this bottling.

Thanks for reading!
