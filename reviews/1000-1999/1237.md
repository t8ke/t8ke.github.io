**The Schtick:** Compass Box The Story of the Spaniard is an interesting blend of malts - many matured in sherry or wine casks. Containing Aberlour, Teaninich, some highland malt, Deanston and Glen Elgin malts. It is named The Spaniard after the Spanish wine casks Compass Box works to source for releases like this, which hit once or twice a year.

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Compass Box

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Apples, pears, pepper, light onion. Some sherry notes. Fresh baked bread. 

**Taste:** Thin, not much heat. Honey, pears, almonds, wafer cookies. Light pepper. Fresh baked bread. 

**Finish:** Short, a bit of heat but not too much. Pepper, sulfur, apples, pears, walnuts. 

**Overall:** This is nice, but a bit thin and unremarkable for what it's supposed to be. The extra sulfur in the finish is a bit of a downer also. 

Thanks for reading!
