[**Review #1225 | Scotch Review #419 - Jura Seven Wood**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1225-jura-seven-wood)

**The Schtick:** This is an Official Bottling by Jura. Matured in 7 types of wood, this release promises to be interesting. New to the core lineup in 2018, I'm curious what motivated the brand to really show up those other brands with triple wood aging and go for gold with 7 types of wood. Either way, let's see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** Jura

**Bottler:** Jura

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  42% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Musty, pungent must, some salinity. Oak, fresh cut grass, old cardboard. Weirdly - lots of corn, vanilla, almost a sickly sweet aroma. All over the place. 

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel with a bit of heat. Musty, young tasting. Cut grass, cardboard, lightly lactic. Some honey sweetness, then some light ash and sea air. 

**Finish:** Short, hot and grossly musty and unpleasant. 

**Overall:** Really not a fan of this. There are a million things going on and only one or two of them good. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
