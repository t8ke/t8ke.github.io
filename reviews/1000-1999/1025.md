**The Schtick:** WhistlePig is a hybrid spirits operation in Vermont that has previously staked its claim on importing rye whiskey from Alberta to age and bottle in Vermont. In the past, Ive bumped into some of their single barrel ryes and found them really enjoyable. In recent months, WhistlePig has made a switch to digging up some older MGP rye stock for their 10 year old single barrel barrel proof rye, as well. As a result, I have set out to try 25 WhistlePig single barrel ryes to get a lay of the land. There are one or two non-WhistlePig ryes in here, also, so the stakes are pretty high. All blind, all in. Welcome to the 2019 Ryenaissance. 

-----

**Distiller:** Alberta

**Bottler:** Whistle Pig

**Selection:** Total Wine

**ABV:** 57.3% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, bright pear. Apples, cherry. Caramel, fresh baked bread. Musty rye spice. Pipe tobacco.  

**Taste:** Thick, rich. Copper penny, caramel, toffee, bright clove spice. Sweet vanilla, light orange peel.  

**Finish:** Long, sweet, spicy. Clove, pepper, pipe tobacco. Orange peel, caramel, fresh baked donuts. 

**Overall:** Really enjoyable. Powerful rye presence, with that fruity Alberta touch. Great start to an exciting adventure. Definitely calling this as an Alberta sourced single barrel, and its a delicious kick off. 

Thanks for reading!
