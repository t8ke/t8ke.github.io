**Nose:**  Limes, vanilla, honey, pepper, faint brine, crisp lemon zest. Faint clove.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Sweet and effervescent. Lots of limes, lemon zest and pepper. Light cardamom, faint basic, confectioners sugar. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and citrus. Almost a light vanilla sweetness, but brought back in check with some more lime zest and cracked pepper. 

**Overall:** Really delicious. If you are looking for a citrus kick, this will serve that with little trouble. It made a phenomenal gimlet, as well as a delicious gin and tonic. 

Thanks for reading!
