**The Schtick:** WhistlePig is a hybrid spirits operation in Vermont that has previously staked its claim on importing rye whiskey from Alberta to age and bottle in Vermont. In the past, Ive bumped into some of their single barrel ryes and found them really enjoyable. In recent months, WhistlePig has made a switch to digging up some older MGP rye stock for their 10 year old single barrel barrel proof rye, as well. As a result, I have set out to try 25 WhistlePig single barrel ryes to get a lay of the land.  They were arranged, poured and blinded by a generous fellow who loves rye as much (or very plausibly more so) than I do. There are one or two non-WhistlePig ryes in here, also, so the stakes are pretty high. All blind, all in. Welcome to the 2019 Ryenaissance.

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** WhistlePig

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 56.95% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Big bold molasses, and brown sugar. Maple candies. Thick rich pipe tobacco. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Really reserved heat. Brown sugar and molasses are notable here. Some toffee. Light baking spices, notably nutmeg. Pipe tobacco. Musty, earthy, lumber. 

**Finish:** Medium length, but growing hot and herbal. Minty, floral, spicy. Pepper, cloves, ethanol. Coats well, but feels thin at the same time. 

**Overall:** This started wonderfully then went downhill once the palate got going. The herbal character just overran the flavor palate. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
