**The Schtick:** This is a sourced rye bottled for Barrell Spirits. It was distilled at Alberta in Canada, and was aged for 13 years before being bottled at cask strength, with no coloring or filtering. 

-----

**Distiller:** Alberta

**Bottler:** Barrell

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 63.45% ABV

**Age:** 13 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, pepper, orange peel. Fresh baked bread, oak, some caramel. Lot more ethanol than I expected.

**Taste:** Thick and rich but hot. Copper penny, honey, oak, orange peel. Caramel, really powerful rye spice. Clove, wintergreen, brown sugar and maple. 

**Finish:** Long, but really hot, sweet and loaded with spice. Really herbal and peppery, loads of clove. Faint molasses and brown sugar. 

**Overall:**  I liked this, but wish it would have stuck with some more of the bread-y, sweet, caramel forward notes from the nose and beginning of the palate. The herbal notes really stepped in with an overpowering presence that I felt left it a bit unbalanced. 

Thanks for reading!
