**Distiller:** Chateau du Tariquet

**Bottler:** Chateau du Tariquet

**Selection:** N/A

**Nose:**  Pears, peach ring candies. Rich, pungent vanilla, almost some perfume. Really floral. Balancing out is musty pipe tobacco.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel with no heat. Vanilla bean, toffee, nougat. The dessert notes are really developing in the palate and pair nicely with more peach rings and tobacco from the nose. 

**Finish:** Medium length. Rich cocoa, honey, caramel, finally more of those signature peach ring candies. Lots of rich pipe tobacco here. 

**Overall:** This was really nice. Vibrant and effervescent, with some well aged brandy notes also. The fruitiness was off the charts in the nose but gave way to rich dessert notes like vanilla and caramel in the palate and the finish blended into a deep, cocoa and tobacco dominant exit. I really enjoyed this, and cant wait to try the 15yr that I have on the way. 

Thanks for reading!
