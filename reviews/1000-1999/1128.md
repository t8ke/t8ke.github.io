**The Schtick:** This is a single marrying cask from Compass Boxs GKS Artist Blend line of expressions. It was finished in a lowland grain whiskey cask for just shy of a year, and yieled 228 bottles. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Compass Box

**Selection:** Bounty Hunter

**ABV:**  49% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet cream, honey, fresh baked bread. Apples and pears. Light, musty sherry. Faint baking spices. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Apples, pears, lightly grain-y. Sweet, fresh baked bread. Some mild heat. Faint bitterness along with some musty sherry notes. 

**Finish:** Short and a bit harsh. More heat here than the nose or palate, and a little shorter than Id prefer. Lots of apples, fresh bread and pear. 

**Overall:** While interesting and different, this didnt perform as well as I had hoped. That  said, the increase in ABV is a huge boon to these releases, as is their relatively good value. This cask just happened to punch a bit less hard than other offerings, although they are always fun to try. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
