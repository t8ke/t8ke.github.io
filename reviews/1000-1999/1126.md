**Selection:** N/A

**Nose:**  Powerful peach essence, sweet vanilla, faint citrus and a light butter cream presence.   

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel, no heat. Light creamy sweetness, faint orange and a healthy dose of very naturally tasting peach. No peach ring candy here, which was a fear of mine going into this. 

**Finish:** Short, mild, lightly peachy. Faint heat. Short finish. 

**Overall:** Honestly, this is a product for cocktails. Thats why I bought it, but over the course of the bottle, I realized it was also delicious neat or with a cube. The lack of gross syrupy sweetness and the lovely floral character was welcome and delicious. It was refreshing with diet lemonade or seltzer water and a cucumber and lime slice in the hot months. I really enjoy this in all of its forms. 

Thanks for reading!
