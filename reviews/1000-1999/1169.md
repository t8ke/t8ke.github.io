**The Schtick:** This is a fun project that a friend of mine undertook - barrel aging Rumfire overproof Hampden Estate rum in a mini barrel for 90 days. The barrel was 5L in volume, and charred to #3 spec. Overall, evaporation was about 8% and ABV dropped about 3%. This is bottled at 60% ABV.

**Distiller:** Hampden Estate

**Bottler:** WhiskyCurator

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Nose:**  Honey, papaya, apples, funky caramel, nougat. The funk is there and it is powerful, but it blends so well with hints of caramel, honey, nougat, cocoa, and toffee. Nose is pretty sweet overall with lots of vanilla bean, powerful funk and fruits. 

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel. Restrained ethanol. Toffee, caramel, honey, banana, papaya and mango. The funk begins to really take hold here, as does the ethanol, but nothing insane. The time in the barrel, however short, really seems to have tamed this well. 

**Finish:** Medium, ashy and rubbery. Honey, pears, pralines, wook and pepper. 

**Overall:** I love this until the finish, where things seem to fall apart. Ash, young wood, some mustiness and general disjointedness sort of kills the sweet desserty funky train ride. That said, it's still wild in cocktails where this is far less evident. 

Thanks for reading!
