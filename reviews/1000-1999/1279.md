**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of spirit distilled at Tobermory - Ledaig is peated Tobermory - and bottled by The Whiskey Exchange for their 10th anniversary. This bottle was chosen to represent the "present future" in their anniversary display at the Whiskey Show. It is matured in a sherry butt. 

-----

**Distiller:** Tobermory

**Bottler:** The Whiskey Exchange

**Selection:** The Whiskey Exchange

**ABV:** 58.4% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Thick, syrupy and rich. Honey, almonds, ash and minerality. Some sweet berries and stewed fruits like blackberry, strawberry and lemon. Light pepper character. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, with some heat. Light toasted almond, almost an amaretto note. Then the fruits hit, nice structure of black currant, cassis, strawberry and light toffee. The ash is back, with some brine, mossy peat and tree bark notes. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and sweet with a dry finish. The oak structure here is just right, with the fruits and gingerbread making for a sweet departure. Ash lingers. 

**Overall:** Great selection here by TWE for their Whisky Show anniversary. Really nice stuff reminding me of the glut of 8-14yr sherried Ledaig Signatory's that were around 3-4 years ago. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
