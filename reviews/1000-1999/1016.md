**The Schtick:** This is a collaboration selection done by a store and a society of a Compass Box marrying cask release. These are releases that take a Great King Street vatting and further mature it in another cask of one type or another. This was a sherried cask. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Compass Box

**Selection:** Houston Bourbon Society

**ABV:**  49% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Pungent honey, rich toffee. Fresh baked bread. Faintly lactic. Apple cobbler, pears, rich dates and figs. Light sulfur. Really nice overall. Very rich.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Really subdued heat. Rich salted caramel, crme brulee. Cocoa, light salt and pepper. So very faintly smoky. Figs and stewed fruits. Vanilla cream. 

**Finish:** Short to medium. Gingerbread, honey, toffee, vanilla bean, toffee and salted caramel.  

**Overall:** This was really delightful. An incredibly solid selection. These marrying casks are really interesting and I find myself liking just about every one I try.  

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
