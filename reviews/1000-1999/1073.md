**The Schtick:** This was distilled in 2006 by the now affected Long POnd Distillery. They lost some barrels in a blaze but otherwise seem fine and should be back to us in a decade or two. I have all four releases in the series to review, and this is day two, so lets keep the party going. 

-----

**Distiller:** Long Pond    

**Bottler:** Velier

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 52.5% ABV

**Age:** 13 Years

**Nose:**  Sweet plantain, molasses and mango. Honey, funky melon and banana. Tar, almond liqueur and a funky rotting papaya note.   

**Taste:** Sweet and rich, loaded with melon and banana. It isnt long before the sweet fruit notes give way to tar, rotting fruits and a light plastic note. It doesnt last forever though, with rich succulent brown sugar, molasses and almond and peach notes flooding back. Its certainly a potent dram, but one loaded with complexity. 

**Finish:** Long, but there is definitely some heat here. The funk is really the star of the show here, digging its hooks into your sinuses and throat alike. Tobacco, amaretto, molasses and melon sweetness. 

**Overall:** Every part of this dram is different from the rest, and delightfully so. I really enjoyed this, but it isnt for the faint of heart, or those light sipping evenings. It demands your attention. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
