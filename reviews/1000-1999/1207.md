**Distiller:** Aultmore

**Bottler:** Aultmore

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 62.2% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years

**Nose:**   Honey, amaretto, red vines, fresh baked bread. Light brine. Super sweet toffee and vanilla bean. Amaretto note is really prominent.

**Taste:**  Thick rich mouthfeel. Very prominent heat. Sweet vanilla, light baked bread. Almonds and walnuts. Sweet red fruits like raspberry and blackberry. Light pipe tobacco. Lightly lactic. 

**Finish:** Long but hot. searing heat. Mild sulfur, light pepper. Again - lots of vanilla bean, fresh baked rolls and toffee and amaretto. 

**Overall:** Unfortunately too hot for its own good - shrouding many better flavors.Â 

Thanks for reading!
