-----

**Distiller:** Deanston

**Bottler:** Deanston

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 56.4% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich and syrupy. Indulgant. Honey, syrupy figs. Grape, cocoa, toffee, nutty syrupy sweetness. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Mild heat, if any. Rich honey, toffee, leather. Some stewed fruits - lemon, raspberry, figs, dates. Musty sherry sweetness. Rich and powerful despite a slight rise in ethanol presence. 

**Finish:** Long but a little bit hot. Sweet, light funky. Honey, sweet amaretto. Honey, pear, raspberry, cherry and fig. Light sulfur. 

**Overall:** This was really nice, but the growth in ethanol was a bit unwelcome. That said, excellent deserty flavors. Delightful. 

Thanks for reading!
