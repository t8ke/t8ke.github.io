**The Schtick:** This is a 12 year age stated release from Cragganmore, one of Diageos Classic Malts. Cragganmore lies in the Speyside region, as useless of a classification as that may be, and features some proportion of sherried malt.

**Distiller:** Cragganmore

**Bottler:** Cragganmore

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years

**Nose:**  Sweet, fresh baked bread. Toffee, caramel apple. Light amaretto and toasted almond. Faint pear. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, no real heat. Sweet toffee and caramel, light vanilla bean. Light toasted almonds. Faint oak presence, some sweet, bready notes. Light icing. 

**Finish:** Short, but no heat here, either. Caramel apple, almonds, vanilla, toffee. 

**Overall:** Not super complex, but entirely enjoyable. I am sort of kicking myself for taking so long to try this, and I thoroughly enjoyed working through this bottle. It wont blow your mind, but not every dram needs to. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
