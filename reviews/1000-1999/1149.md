**The Schtick:** Scapa Skiren is a 2015 release from the Orkney distillery. Aged in first-fill American oak casks..." -The Whiskey Exchange. So we have a NAS, ex-bourbon scotch from Scapa. Dont see a lot of product from them, and I definitely miss the 16, so lets see how this fares. 

-----

**Distiller:** Scapa

**Bottler:** Scapa  

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Musty and sweet. Fresh grains, honey, vanilla, light sulfur, nice tobacco note. On the lighter side, no big fruit components. 

**Taste:** Thin, some heat. Young, malty, musty. Vanilla, caramel, honey. Some pepper. Unremarkable, and very young tasting. 

**Finish:** Apples, pears, honey, light musty grains. Short, no heat. 

**Overall:** Really unremarkable showing from Scapa here. What happened to the 12 and 16? The good stuff?! Where is it? This isn't it, and Scapa needs to get their shit together. I know they can do better than this. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
