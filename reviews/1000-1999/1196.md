-----

**Distiller:** Don Baltazar Cruz Gonzales

**Bottler:** Mezcalero

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  48% ABV

**Age:** NA 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet and floral. Clay, honey, earth salt and light smoke. Ashy smoke - not like burning wood or savory meats. Really nice floral component to the agave stank. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Nice body. Salty, earthy, good bit of clay. Pricky ethanol, but not too hot. Leather, tobacco, savory brine. 

**Finish:** Short in length but rich and savory. Honey, seared pears, honey, caramel, light clay and a good deal of earthy character to balance out. 

**Overall:** Really big fan of this one - great complexity and character with flavors I love to keep me coming back for more. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
