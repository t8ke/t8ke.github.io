**The Schtick:** This is a single barrel of bourbon selected by a local wine merchant, Rileys Wines of the World, from Buffalo Trace. It comes in at 45% ABV and features mashbill 1. I've had some real winners from this shop in the past, so I'm curious to see how it is. Let's dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace 

**Selection:** Rileys

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, toffee, caramel and bright fruitiness. Mild on the oak, big on cherry, orange peel and mango. Light vanilla, faint cassia, mostly caramel and fruits. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Honey, peanut brittle, caramel bright orange peel and cherry. 

**Finish:** Long, rich, bit of musty tobacco. Honey, more cherry, and some oak. Good blend of fruits, caramel and oak.

**Overall:** I  could go for a little more oak here, which feels weird to say, but overall I think it's a winner of a barrel all the same. I'd drink more of this, and I plan to. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
