**Nose:**  Huge citrus. Confectioners sugar, honey, lemon, lime, orange peel, light papaya. All fruits. Mild juniper, if any. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Mild and sweet. Vanilla, confectioners sugar, lemon, lime, light sweetness. 

**Finish:** Short, a bit hot, but nice overall. Sweet, lots of citrus, some papaya and then pew, it gone. 

**Overall:** I really like this, and I think its great in cocktails. Its a little hotter than I think it should be, though, but I enjoy that if I'm searching for this profile....I can easily find it. 

Thanks for reading!
