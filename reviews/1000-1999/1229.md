**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of spirit distilled at Highland Park on Orkney and bottled by Duncan Taylor. It was bottled after 19 years of aging, at cask strength with no coloring or filtering after maturation in a hogshead. Let's dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Highland Park

**Bottler:** Duncan Taylor

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 53.7% ABV

**Age:** 19 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Fresh baked bread. Salt, pepper, slight maritime air. Then the fun starts. Apples, pears, rich toffee and creme brulee. Old pipe tobacco, fresh bagels, vanilla cream. Rich, savory, fruity. 

**Taste:** Honey and apples first before a hit of light ash smoke, some faint earthiness. Lots of fresh dough and cake batter, some old musty tobacco and thick vanilla creaminess. 

**Finish:** Long, powerful but complex. Tons of flavor here waffling between the assertive ash and brine and the bakery and sweet fruits. 

**Overall:** I love this. It's expensive, but I'd have a hard time not getting one if I saw it locally. HP nails it again. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
