**The Schtick:** Admittedly, I dont, or at least havent sat down to yet, watch Game of Thrones. But I do like Clynelish, so I took a dive on this one. This bottling represents the house Tyrell in the storys fictional plotline. It is bottled at a higher proof than Clynelish 14, but does  not carry an age statement. 

-----

**Distiller:** Clynelish

**Bottler:** Diageo

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 51.2% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich honey, toffee, waxy fruits. Fresh baked bread. Sweet graham cracker, light brine. Faint pepper and smoke. Vanilla bean.  

**Taste:** Thick, rich mouth feel. Muted heat despite the proof. Honey, sweet apples and pears. Faint fig, and currant. Dole fruit syrup. Infusion of smoke rolls in, present but reserved. Light brine and some clove. Nice pepper note, good oak body despite the relative youth. Syrupy plums. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and filled with smoke, vanilla, pears and fig. Lots of tobacco, earthy richness and some sweetness. 

**Overall:** Incredibly solid. I plan to not make this my last bottle. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
