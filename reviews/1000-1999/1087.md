**The Schtick:** This is a release of 15yr Tariquet spirit bottled at cask strength. It is bottled without coloring or filtering.

-----

**Distiller:** Chateau du Tariquet 

**Bottler:** Chateau du Tariquet

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 47.2% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years

**Nose:**  Sweet, toffee. Loads of Dole fruit syrup. Sweet stewed fruits, honey and fig. Rich cream.   

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No real heat. Sweet syrupy fruits again, but blends well with notes like tobacco, clove and honey. Toffee, sweet fig and peach. 

**Finish:** Medium in length, almost growing savory. More peach, tobacco, and pepper here. Musty and complex. 

**Overall:** A really nice dram. On my next FineDrams order, I will definitely be picking up a bottle. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
