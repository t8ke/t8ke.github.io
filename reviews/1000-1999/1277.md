**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of spirit distilled at Signatory Vintage's Edradour distillery. Matured in first fill sherry casks, this was distilled on February 27th 2009 and bottled at cask strength, without coloring or filtering, on November 16th 2018.

-----

**Distiller:** Edradour

**Bottler:** The Ultimate 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  58% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich, nutty sherry. Toffee, almonds, creme brûlée. Then the fruits arrive. Blackberry, fresh juicy raspberry and cherry. Lots of spirit on the nose. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Mild heat, far less than I’d expect for the proof. Oak, leather, honey, toffee. Sulfur and juicy sherry notes. Cherry, wood shavings, raspberry. No musty old tobacco here - all vibrant fruits. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and powerful. Raspberry, toffee, mild oak and sulfur sherry. 

**Overall:** Powerful and impressive, performing well beyond its age. It’s a hair hot in the finish but the palate has all notes that I like. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
