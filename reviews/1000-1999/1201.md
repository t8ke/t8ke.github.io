**Nose:**   Rich, fungal peat. Seaweed, dead fish, honey, vanilla. Fresh baked bread, rich stewed fruits. Pepper, light ash. The blackberry and currant is powerful and inviting. Sweet and syrupy with an enticing savory backbone.

**Taste:** Thick, rich, loaded with honey. Ashy, filled with burning wood and the sea. Brine, seaweed and pepper. Light rubber presence and then the fruits storm in. Blackberry, fig, currants, cherry, its all here. Caramel is subdued in lieue of big fruit character. Mild oakiness, good tannic structure. Heat is nowhere to be found despite the proof.

**Finish:** Long, rich and sweet. Blackberry jam, apricot and vanilla bean meld with fresh baked cake, ash and a briney, peppery exit. 

**Overall:** Just phenomenal. This was exceptional and I may break my auction drought to hunt down something like this. I need more.

Thanks for reading!
