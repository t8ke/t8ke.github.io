**The Schtick:** Made from the Cenizo agave, Don Nacho (originally of Oaxaca) created this expression in Durango. Distilled at a high elevation, this was produced by fermentation in open air tanks and copper stills. Let's see how it is.  

-----

**Distiller:** Desde Elano Cero

**Bottler:** Desde Elano Cero

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  48% ABV

**Age:** NA

**Nose:**  Fruity, ashy, sweet. Loads of vanilla bean, ashy mineral forward smoke, some light fruits. Lemon zesty. 

**Taste:** Not wildly complex, but interesting. Ashy melons, limes and lemons, paired well with a rich vanilla sweetness. Super unique. Loaded with fruits that I don't often find in a mezcal. 

**Finish:** Long, rich with a bit of heat. Pepper, clay, minerality and melon like honey dew. I can't say I've had much like this before. 

**Overall:** This is a unique combination of flavors I've found in a lot of other Mezcals. Super interesting as the glass went on to become drier while preserving some fruity sweetness. 

Thanks for reading!
