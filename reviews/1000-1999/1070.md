**The Schtick:** This was distilled in 2006 by the now burned down Long POnd Distillery. I have all four releases in the series to review, and this is day one. Lets hop in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Long Pong

**Bottler:** Velier

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 62.5% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet toffee, roasted peanuts. Honey, brine and savory meats. Pineapple, lightly funky, loads of papaya. Really brutish tar note creeps in. Lightly wood, but overall very sweet with a nice fruity and savory streak to it. 

**Taste:** Oh lawd. Brash and powerful. Thick, rich, loaded with salted caramel and some rotting fruit funk. Rich plastic, ash, molasses and honey roasted peanuts. Tons of vanilla here, a bit of oak, the heat is present and powerful. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and complex. Molasses, creme brulee, rich funky fruits. 

**Overall:** This is a powerful dram, but a lovely one. Its brash, complex and delicious. Im already excited for the next one. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
