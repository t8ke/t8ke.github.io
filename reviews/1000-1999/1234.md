**The Schtick:** This is another bottling of MGP spirit under a private label. I tasted this dram blind and then got the reveal at a later time, so keep that in mind as you read through these notes.

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Blaum Bros

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**    % ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Musty and dusty. plums, clove, vanilla. Oddly fruity, with some nice mustier notes to keep things interesting.

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel, fruity and sweet. Good deal of berries, honey, toffee. It's a bit hot, but not punishing. 

**Finish:** Long, fruity and rich. Lots of peanut funk here which is really interesting. 

**Overall:** Hot but delightful in a way that I typically only enjoy from KC SiB's. My guess was a KC SiB of 8-10 years in age, but this turned out to be a MGP sourced product I'd not yet had: Blaum Bros Oldfangled Knotter 12yr. Interesting! 

Thanks for reading!
