**The Schtick:** "Queen's Share Rum is Maggie's Farm award-winning reserve spirit made exclusively from the tail runnings of their normal cane rum distillations. Being heavier than alcohol, the flavor and aroma compounds boil off the still in a higher concentration at the end of the distillation cycle. These tail runnings are then re-distilled on their own, creating a more flavorful and complex spirit. This version is a blend of two Queen's Share batches, one finished in rye whiskey casks and the other in Oloroso sherry butts from Jerez, Spain."-Maggie's Farm. So, this bottle looks to have some pretty unique qualities to it.  Let's see how it is.
