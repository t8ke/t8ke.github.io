**The Schtick:** "It is a dry column using 100% sugar cane in Okinawa.                                                                                                                             +
Characterized by taste and rich flavor of the sugar cane.                                                                                                                         +
HELIOS distillery using sugar cane in Okinawa in 1961                                                                                                                             +
From the rum-making began.                                                                                                                                                        +
This is Matsuda Tadashi, the founder's "wine in the land sourced is made from crops"                                                                                              +
Principle and is the starting point.                                                                                                                                              +
"Heliosram" is a wine exactly the origin of the Helios distillery said." For maximum authenticity, I took the Japanese and translated it to English using Google, so here we are. 

-----

**Distiller:** Helios 

**Bottler:** Helios

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Sweet, musty, tomatoes, overripe fruits. Really really really sweet in a rotting fruit way without that big ester punch. Really weird. Light vinegar. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium. Really strange. Sweet and earthy, musty and funky. VInegar, tomatoes, banana, odd oerfume note I cant put my finger on. 

**Finish:** Short, sweet and funky. Oddly fruity again in a way I can't descripbe

**Overall:** This is super weird and interesting but it's not for me. It's so sweet and pungent in a non estery way that leaves me with the strangest impression. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
