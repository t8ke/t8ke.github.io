**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of Dickel spirit, bottled by Barrell spirits in their new line of premium sourced bottlings. Clocking in at 15 years old with an ABV of 52.55, this is the oldest Barrel release I've had to date. Let's dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Dickel

**Bottler:** Barrell

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 52.55% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Oak, musty sweetness, corn, orange zest. Creamy sweetness that is almost mistakeable for youth. 

**Taste:** Honey, apples, pears, strong vitamin notes. Chalky, loaded with corn notes and apple cobbler. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet. Lots of corn, oak, cocoa, typical vitamin and orange peel. 

**Overall:** Not a fan of this, but it's Dickel ramped up to 11. Whatever KY and IN distillate in here is pretty trodden over with that profile. I don't love it, but I don't hate it. It's not my favorite, though. Side by side with a bottle of off the shelf BT, this would be a tough choice. 

Thanks for reading!
