**The Schtick:** "Bowmore 9 Year Old is the latest addition to the Islay favourite's core range. This entry-level whisky has spent all of its life maturing in a combination of bourbon and sherry casks, resulting in a rich whisky with notes of cocoa, dark fruits and cr√®me caramel, along with Bowmore's trademark smoky backbone." - The Whiskey Exchange.  So we have a young Bowmore with some time in a sherry cask. I'm wary, but interested. Let's see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** Bowmore

**Bottler:** Bowmore

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Prune, apple, effervescent acetone. Plum, sweet floral note. Fake cherry and fake respberry. Fake fruit, almost gummy worm like. 

**Taste:** Thin, no heat. Apricot, apple. Pear, light leather. Faint toffee. If there is peat, it is dim. 

**Finish:** Short, a bit of heat. Apricot, sulfur, pepper, honey, vanilla. 

**Overall:** Not great, not exceptional. Unremarkable, at the best. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
