**The Schtick:** "Blending in the same fashion as our regular 50/50 Dark Rum, Maggieâ€™s 50/50 Pineapple Dark Rum is made by macerating fresh pineapple in an imported aged rum to capture the natural fruity sweetness. Then, we vapor distill our own white rum through pineapple barks to capture the natural oils. Both rums are combined in equal measurements to capture the full essence of the tropical fruit with no artificial ingredients." - Maggies Farm. So this really appears to be interesting. Let's see how this is, and how it stacks up against other pineapple rums in the space.

**Distiller:** Maggies Farm

**Bottler:** Maggies Farm

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Very sweet and floral. Perfumely, loads of banana and nutty funk. The sweetness is incredible.

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel, with some heat. Quickly dives into the pineapple, with a bit of banana, pear, apricot and toffee. Crazy artificial flavor though, which is dissapointing. Lots of nutty caramel and growing heat. 

**Finish:** Short, sweet, lack of heat. Growing vanilla. Lots more artificial pineapple, melon, banana. 

**Overall:** Weird, super sweet, funky and artificial. Super floral. Overall, while this was a super cool product to drink through, if I'm in the mood for pineapple rum, I'm going Stiggin's.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
