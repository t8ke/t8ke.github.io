**The Schtick:** "A relaunch of Havana Clubs Cuban Barrel Proof edition, Seleccin de Maestros has benefited from an eye-catching packaging upgrade and is bottled at 45% for extra oomph. The Gold Medal-winning liquid inside Havana Club Seleccin de Maestros remains the same as for the old Cuban Barrel Proof - as the name suggests, the casks have been hand-picked by the maestros roneros from the companys finest aged stocks. The rums selected by the maestros roneros are finished in special casks chosen for their aromatic properties before being bottled at a higher strength than the standard range for a more intense, immediate flavour on the palate." - The Whiskey Exchange

**Distiller:** Havana Club

**Bottler:** Havana Club        

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  45% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet, nutty, amaretto. Caramel, light fudge, toffee. Faintly artificial, loads of sweetness, light fruitiness. 

**Taste:** Thin on the palate but no heat. Mild bitterness. Toffee, more nutty character along with light pepper and mango.

**Finish:** Short, hot but sweet. Lots of amaretto, with some bitter plastic, light ash and toffee.

**Overall:**  Overall, not bad but generally thin and a bit artificial. This would be a fine mixer, and I bet it would stand up well to balance a big funky rum in a cocktail, maybe.

Thanks for reading!
