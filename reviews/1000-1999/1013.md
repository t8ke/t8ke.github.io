**The Schtick:** This is the third release in Old Foresters vintage based line of expressions. This release is supposedly made in pursuit of replicating Old Foresters production during Prohibition - although there is no word of how that actually differs. The main sticking point of this release is the boost in proof - it is bottled at 115 proof.

**Distiller:** Brown-Forman

**Bottler:** Brown-Forman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 57.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Honey, rich nougat. Fresh hot pralines. Nutty sweetness, peanut brittle. Caramel. Sweet vanilla cream. Light pipe tobacco.  

**Taste:** Medium to thick mouth feel. Sweet honey. Nougat. Caramel. Light oak presence. Graham cracker. Rich and sweet with some good structure. Faint clove and pipe tobacco. A good bit of heat though.

**Finish:** Long rich and sweet. Lightly spicy, some honey and caramel. Vanilla cream, cocoa and nutty sweetness. 

**Overall:** Really nice, although there is some heat. This is super solid, though, and Im glad its almost universally available. This is easily my favorite entry in the vintage line. Great stuff.

Thanks for reading!
