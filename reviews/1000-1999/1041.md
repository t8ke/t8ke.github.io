**The Schtick:** "Made from 100% Irish malted barley, the Sexton is triple distilled in copper pot stills and aged in former Oloroso sherry casks."

-----

**Distiller:** Bushmills

**Bottler:** Bushmills

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 45 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Toffee, caramel, ethanol and raisin bread. Really rich nose, which I found surprising.   

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel, mild heat. Leather, tobacco, honey and pear. What rich sherry existed on the nose isnt really here in the palate. 

**Finish:** Short, mild, but loaded with peach ring candy, pears, honey and some tobacco.

**Overall:** All things considered, this was really interesting. The nose was easily the best part, with the palate and finish being generally thin and unremarkable but the nose did impress me. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
