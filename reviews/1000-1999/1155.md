**The Schtick:** This is an indepenent bottling of spirit distilled on Orkney by Highland Park. It is rumored to have been part of a large selling of Edrington owned casks in order to finance Macallan's new distillery in KLWines opinion. It is bottled by John Milroy collection for KLWines. It is bottled at cask strength with no filtering or coloring. Distilled in 1999 and bottled in 2017. 

-----

**Distiller:** HIghland Park

**Bottler:** John Milroy

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 54.1% ABV

**Age:** 18 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, faint must, sweet cream, fresh baked bread, lemon. 

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel, no heat. Sweet fresh baked bread, honey, lemon zest, light pepper, faint ash. Not really super bold in any single respect. Heat grows with time, though. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and smoky. The smoke grows to overpower any sweetness, the lemon is gone, and the breads are on fire. 

**Overall:** Nice, but really disjointed. Nose is sweet and light and then that all fades to ash and ethanol by the finish. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
