[**Review #1127 | Bourbon Review #566 - Jack Daniels Single Barrel Barrel Proof**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1127-jack-daniels-single-barrel-barrel-proof/)

**The Schtick:** This is a single barrel offering from Jack Daniels that is bottled at barrel proof with no coloring or filtering. Ive seen some level of success with these in the past, although my current opinion is that in the past the variability of the barrels has been through the roof. Ive noticed this less in the last year or so, and hope that like Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserves, Jack Daniels is also dialing in their QC for this line of products.

**Nose:**  Sweet oak, cracked pepper, honey roasted peanuts. Light banana, lots of caramel. 

**Taste:** Hot, but thick and rich. Honey, caramel, bananas foster. Honey roasted peanut, oak and tannic dryness. Not overly dry, but less desserty than some of these Ive had in the past. 

**Finish:** Long and rich, but a bit hot. The proof is evident, but not punishing. Tons of banana here, oak, caramel, honey and graham cracker. Its like a banana split. 

**Overall:**  Pretty on the mark for this barrel. A banana bomb with some caramel and oak and ethanol. I really enjoy these, and am happy to see what I feel is an uptick in their general quality and consistency. 

Thanks for reading!
