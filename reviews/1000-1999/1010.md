**The Schtick:** This is a single cask of Kilchoman that is one of their oldest: 10 years old. It was matured in an Oloroso sherry butt

-----

**Distiller:** Kilchoman

**Bottler:** Kilchoman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 55.6% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Toffee, caramel, rich currant and blackberry. Yeasty, fresh baked bread. Brine, light ethanol, soapstone and pepper.   

**Taste:** Sweet, loaded with honey and raspberry, as well as some blackberry. Ashy, woody smoke, lots of minerality. 

**Finish:** Long, rich, but hot. Lots of charcoal, berries, currants and smoldering wood. 

**Overall:** This was also really nice, but the nose continued the trend of being the best part. I had hoped for more syrupy sherry characteristics to blend with the ashy structure, but no dice. That said, this was still very enjoyable, and a pleasure to drink through. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
