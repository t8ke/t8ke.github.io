**The Schtick:** WhistlePig is a hybrid spirits operation in Vermont that has previously staked its claim on importing rye whiskey from Alberta to age and bottle in Vermont. In the past, Ive bumped into some of their single barrel ryes and found them really enjoyable. In recent months, WhistlePig has made a switch to digging up some older MGP rye stock for their 10 year old single barrel barrel proof rye, as well. As a result, I have set out to try 25 WhistlePig single barrel ryes to get a lay of the land.  They were arranged, poured and blinded by a generous fellow who loves rye as much (or very plausibly more so) than I do. There are one or two non-WhistlePig ryes in here, also, so the stakes are pretty high. All blind, all in. Welcome to the 2019 Ryenaissance.

-----

**Distiller:** Alberta

**Bottler:** Whistle Pig

**Selection:** PA Fine Wine and Good Spirits

**ABV:** 55.95% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich herbal and floral essence. Perfume-y. Honey, orange peel, cedar and vanilla bean 

**Taste:** Honey, caramel, toffee. Light spice, then clove kicks in. Rich spice, sweet honey. Fresh baked bread. Some oak and tobacco, vibrant sweetness. Some heat though 

**Finish:** Long but at the price of some heat. Dry and oaky, lots of tobacco, vanilla, cream, pepper and clove

**Overall:** Returning to a vein I enjoy more. Dry, oaky, but with sweetness and more floral body. 

Thanks for reading!
