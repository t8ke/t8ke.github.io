-----

**Distiller:** Moneymusk

**Bottler:** The Ultimatum

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years

**Nose:**  Sweet mango, pineapple, vanilla. Rich Dole fruit syrup, light funk and some caramel. Lots of nice ripe banana. Overall, on the lighter side, but an enticing nose. 

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel. No real heat. Caramel, honey, light esters and pear. Faint ham note, mango, some plantain. 

**Finish:** Medium length finish, some mild heat. Less sweet here but fruity and floral. Honey, apples, light mango, faint banana.

**Overall:** Honestly, this wasnt bad, but it was thin and disjointed. A little longer finish and a bit richer mouth feel and wed be in business on this one. That said, I wish I had more of this so I could play with it in some cocktails. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
