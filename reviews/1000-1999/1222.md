[**Review #1222 | Gin Review #18 - Kirkland London Dry Gin**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1222-kirkland-london-dry-gin)

**The Schtick:** This is a Kirkland branded release from Costco Warehouses. Distilled by an undisclosed producer, this gin comes to us in a London Dry Style for a reasonable price. Let's see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Kirkland

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 41.5% ABV

**Age:** N/A 

-----

**Nose:**  Super bright and fresh. Juniper, citrus, floral and perfumey. Light confectioners sugar. Some pepper. Juniper really dominates, along with some coriander. 

**Taste:** Syrupy mouth feel, richer than expected. Sweet, confectioners sugar, pepper, orange peel and juniper. Nice floral presence, with a bit of a corn note. Weird, but I like it. 

**Finish:** Short, junipery and heavily floral, light ethanol here. It's crisp and clean though and doesn't linger on any one spice. 

**Overall:** Good but not incredible, but full bodied and versatile. This works great neat, on the rocks or in a variety of cocktails. I'd buy it again, which is what I plan to do. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
