**Distiller:** Bushmills

**Bottler:** Bushmills

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Bready, cake forward nose. Light citrus. Vanilla cream. Faint peach.  

**Taste:** Thin with mild heat on the palate. Vanilla, peach ring candies, light grain presence and some plum. 

**Finish:** Short, mild heat. Bread forward, some more light fruit, raisin bread, this super strange yam/brown sugar / sweet potato note is there too. 

**Overall:** This was sort of all over the place and I really didnt mind it. I think there is some work to be done here, yet, but all in all, this exceeded my expectations for what I thought it would deliver.  

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
