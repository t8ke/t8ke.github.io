**The Schtick:** This is a distillery bottling of Highland Park spirit selected by Bevmo. It was distilled in 2004 and bottled in 2017, matured fully in a 1st fill European Sherry Butt. This cask, number 6737, was bottled at cask strength with no coloring or filtering.

-----

**Distiller:** Highland Park

**Bottler:** Highland Park

**Selection:** Bevmo

**ABV:** 65.3% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Syrupy and loaded with sweetness and fruit. Hot, ethanol abounds. Oak, tons of wood and sulfur. Light vanilla, searing heat.   

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel but good lord the heat. This is punishing, hot and sulfurous. There are a lot of syrupy fruits, and some fresh baked bread and vanilla, but they are buried beneath the heat and sulfur. 

**Finish:** Medium, hot and loaded with sulfur, musty wet cardboard, syrupy raspberry vanilla and oak.

**Overall:** Man, Highland Park isnt usually actively bad, but this really drops the ball. This is hot, sulfurous as hell, and honestly just unpleasant. Im surprised BevMo would have selected this cask, and Im surprised Highland Park would have sold this. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
