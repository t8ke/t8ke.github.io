**The Schtick:** Kilchoman Machir bay is named after one of Islays beaches near Kilchoman. This is a special vatting for a local retailer that is comprised of a blend of 85% ex-Buffalo Trace bourbon barrel spirit and 15% Oloroso cask matured spirit. It is bottled at 46% ABV with no filtering or coloring. The vattings are done in 30 barrel batches, and use barley peated to the supplier standard of 55ppm.

**Distiller:** Kilchoman

**Bottler:** Kilchoman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Kiwi, honey, lemon and cream. Rich phenols. Wet and musty, wet grass, charcoal, soap stone and ash. 

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel, some heat. Lots of honey, malty wet grass. burning rubber. Some sulphur and butter cream.

**Finish:** Short, ashy and loaded with lemon and vanilla. 

**Overall:** This is good, but young and very little wine influence. Definitely not bad, and a great starter from Kilchoman, but there is some work to be done. I think most of the flaws here just stem from being young. 

Thanks for reading!
