[**Review #1064 | Gin Review #11 - Phillips Gin**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1064-phillips-gin/)

**The Schtick:** This is a gin distilled and released by the Phillips Distilling Company. 

-----

**Distiller:** Phillips Distilling Company

**Bottler:** Phillips Distilling Company

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Ethanol, faint sweetness. Light juniper. Very muted depth beyond ethanol.   

**Taste:** Hot and thin, with lots of pepper, a faint plastic astringency and sugar. 

**Finish:** Short, hot, thin and astringent. 

**Overall:** This is a definite pass in my book, especially comparing its competition from some other bargain gins. There was nothing horribly offensive, but it was thin, and carried more heat and astringency than it should have. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
