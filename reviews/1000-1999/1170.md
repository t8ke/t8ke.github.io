**Distiller:** Balblair

**Bottler:** Balblair

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Nose:**  Apples, honey, soapstone and light sulfur. Faint pepper. Not a ton going on here.   

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel, no heat. Sweet honey, light crushed stone. Pepper, light salinity, very faint smoke and ash to it. 

**Finish:** Short, a bit of heat here. Ash, pepper, light salinity and soap stone. 

**Overall:** Overall, this was nice, but not really remarkable. The profile was interesting, but the thin mouth feel and short finish as well as the one dimensional palate and finish left me wanting more. 

Thanks for reading!
