[**Review #1011 | Bourbon Review #524 - Old Forester 1910: Old Fine Whiskey**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1011-old-forester-1910-old-fine-whiskey/)

**The Schtick:** This is a double barrel bourbon release from Old Forester as an entry in their vintage line of expressions. It is first matured in a normal bourbon cask, then moved to a second, highly charred barrel. 

-----

**Distiller:** Brown-Forman

**Bottler:** Brown-Forman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 46.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Really prominent maple, brown sugar and clove. Sweet melon, light banana. Baking spices. Honey.   

**Taste:** Thin to medium. Sort of muted. Sugar, light clove, some spice. Not a lot here. Oddly dry and oaky.

**Finish:** Short, lots of oak here. Cocoa. Sawdust. Weirdly musty. Overwhelming fake cocoa and oak.  

**Overall:** This isnt for me. Its one dimensional, disappointing in the palate and finish, and generally not too complex. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
