**The Schtick:** This is a young single cask of Amrut spirit that was bottled at cask strength after aging for 7 years, entirely in an oloroso cask. 

-----

**Distiller:** Amrut

**Bottler:** Amrut

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich nutty toffee, honey and figs. Sweet cream, light oak, faint must, some tobacco. 

**Taste:** Sweet and rich mouth feel. Medium thickness. Honey, toffee, rich syrupy fruits. A bit of heat, but really well behaved for the proof. Apples, blackberry, figs, currant and cherry. Syrupy, musty pipe tobacco. 

**Finish:** Short, but not too hot. A bit more oak here, lightly musty. The syrupy fruits continue. 

**Overall:** Pretty great stuff compared to pretty much all of the Amrut I've had at the time of this tasting. The sherry notes and the apparent age despite its actual youth is impressive and delicious. Nice work, Amrut. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
