[**Review #1171 | Mezcal Review #16 - Alipus Ana del Rio**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1171-alipus-ana-del-rio/)

**The Schtick:** Alip√∫s is a series made from contracted mezcales, purchased and marketed by the Danzantes group in Oaxaca, and imported into California by Craft Distillers. Each label corresponds to a specific village where the producer is located. All of them are made entirely from Espadin agave (with the exception of the San Andres that has a smidge of something else thrown in during fermentation). - KLWines. I've had several Alipus varietals before, and all have been fine to great, so I'm looking forward to trying one more. Here we go. 

-----

**Distiller:** Alipus

**Bottler:** Alipus

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  42% ABV

**Age:** NA 

-----

**Nose:**  So very sweet in a very pleasant way. Honey, vanilla bean, confectioners sugar. Really faint on the agave stank front - not a lot of earth or mineral or ammonia at all. Just a sweet, buttery nose. 

**Taste:** Really different from the nose. Confectioners sugar, pepper, sulfur, ammonia, brine, and light rubber. Powerful and savory in a very chemical forward manner. 

**Finish:** Medium in length - lots of plastic, copper, ash and earth. 

**Overall:** Delicious and savory. Not too overpowering, but a really powerful set of notes. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
