**The Schtick:**  This is a Glenmorangie expression that takes the 10yr core expression and finishes it for 2 additional years in a suternes wine cask. It also gets a slight bump in proof, much like the Lasanta and the Quinta Ruban.

-----

**Distiller:** Glenmorangie

**Bottler:** Glenmorangie

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet honey, cake batter. Rich toffee. Buttery sweetness. Really sweet, light fruits, but mostly a caramel, toffee, vanilla cake bomb 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Surprisingly buttery. No real heat. Sweet cream, honey, toffee. Light pepper and tobacco, faint earthiness. Overall though its all sweet and cake-y. 

**Finish:** Short with little heat. Some pretty apparent bitterness is here, although it is along with loads of caramel and sweetness.  

**Overall:** Great until the finish, which seems more or less like a pretty consistent gripe I have with some of these entry expressions from the core line. That said, its not bad, but I still think the Quinta is my favorite of the core offerings. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
