**The Schtick:** This is a straggling bottle from my previous Knob Creek Rodeo. I bought two of this particular pick when prepping for the series, and now, almost a full year later, I finally cracked into it, shared it with some friends, and finished it offf, taking notes all the way. I wonder how much this experience will differ from the botte right after it was released. 

-----

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam

**Selection:** PPLD

**ABV:**  60% ABV

**Age:** 13 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Oak, clove, heavy maple and toffee. Gingerbread, waffle cone, peanut brittle and hit of ethanol. 

**Taste:** Thick, rich mouth feel, with lots of honey. Theres some heat here, but its not punishing for the proof. Honey roasted peanuts, oak, caramel, and graham cracker. Some marshmallow. Really interesting. 

**Finish:** Long, some heat. Oaky, with caramel, nutty peanut brittle and waffle cone making another reappearance. 

**Overall:** Really enjoyable bottle, and Im glad it remained so. I remember really enjoying the maple, waffle cone and brittle notes before, and was glad to find them again. I have bought a lot less of these in recent days because I covered so many in such a short period of time, but I still am of the mind that these bottlings are one of the best, if not THE best, value in bourbon. 

Thanks for reading!
