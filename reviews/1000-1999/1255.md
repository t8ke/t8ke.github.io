**Distiller:**  Edradour

**Bottler:**  Edradour

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 66.3% ABV

**Age:** 13 Years

**Nose:**  Big, brash wine. Raspberry, sulphur, musty pipe tobacco. Some ethanol here. Stewed fruits, currants, blackberry, pepper.

**Taste:** Thick and rich. Raspberry, cherry cordial candy. Cocoa, musty tobacco. Honey, blackberry, currant and a well integrated oak presence. Syrupy and powerful. Heat is shockingly tame despite the monstrous proof.

**Finish:** Long, powerful and rich. Cocoa, jammy blackberry and strawberry. Faintly nutty, some pecan, lots of rich tobacco. Slightly drying, faint tannins.

**Overall:** Really phenomenal bottling that manages to accentuate big, bold flavors, without ripping your head off or succumbing too cloying sweetness or massive bitterness. Really, really impressive.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
