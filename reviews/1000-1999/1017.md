**The Schtick:** This is a single barrel of Brown-Forman distillate selected by an Illinois retailer. It is bottled at barrel proof. 

-----

**Distiller:** Jack Daniels

**Bottler:** Jack Daniels

**Selection:** Kenwood Liquors

**ABV:** 64.8% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Really rich honey, toffee, tobacco and banana bread. Rich, buttery, very powerful nose.   

**Taste:** Thick and rich. Little heat despite the proof. Rich buttery caramels, crme brulee, molasses, salted caramel. Strong oak body, without being too dry. Honey roasted peanuts and banana are also present. Dry tobacco at the end. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and rich. A bit hotter here. Lots of bananas, honey roasted nuts, oak, pepper and some clove.

**Overall:** Incredibly complex and well done for JD. Some of these barrels are winners and this is one of them.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
