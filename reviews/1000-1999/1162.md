[**Review #1162 | Mezcal Review #13 - Ilegal Reposado Mezcal**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1162-ilegal-reposado/)

**The Schtick:** This is a 100% Espadin Mezcal that spends 4 months aging in American oak barrels. It is produced in the same manner as the recent [Ilegal Joven] that I recently reviewed. 

-----

**Distiller:** Ilegal

**Bottler:** Ilegal

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**    % ABV

**Age:** .75 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet nectar, stinky agave, vinegar, pickled onion, peach and pepper. Really powerful but inviting. 

**Taste:** Sweet and rich, medium mouth feel. Honey, agave nectar, sweet cream. Pepper, light salinity. Smoke is very dialed back compared to the Joven. Fruits like berry and peach are prominent. Surprisingly strong vanilla. Faint cassia.

**Finish:** Medium in length and the barrel influence is very prominent. Marshmallow, vanilla, cassia and honey are there alongside prickly pear, star fruit and peach. Light pepper plays well across all notes. 

**Overall:** Im a big fan of this despite it straying from traditional unaged mezcal roots. The barrel influence is undeniable but delicious. It also makes a very lovely paloma. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
