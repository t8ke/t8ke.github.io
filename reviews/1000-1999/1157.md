**The Schtick:** "Master Distiller Brent Elliott selected and mingled six of Four Rosesâ€™ 10 Bourbon recipes, each aged a minimum of 6 years, to handcraft Small Batch Select. Non-chill filtered and 104 proof, our newest permanent product-line extension" - Four Roses. So, this is a well proofed, NCF batched offering from Four Roses. Let's see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  52% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Super sweet - more than expected. Toffee, nougat, clove. Lots of rich pepper, some oak, and baking spice. Not too much ethanol. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Some heat but lots of clove, baking spice, cracked pepper, honey and toffee. 

**Finish:** Medium in length. Toffee, oak, honey roasted peanuts. Overall, this is pretty nice. Bit of nougat, some peanut brittle, light pepper. 

**Overall:** Overall, I enjoyed this, but I don't know it's the best thing since sliced bread. I'd happily drink it with some frequency but I don't know that I'll be doing so at the price its going for here. 

Thanks for reading!
