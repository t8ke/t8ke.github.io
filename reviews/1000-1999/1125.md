**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of Glenrothes spirit by Cadenheads that was selected for the Napa, California retailer Bounty Hunter Wine and Spirits. It was matured in a sherry butt and bottled at cask strength without filtering or coloring. 

-----

**Distiller:** Glenrothes

**Bottler:** Cadenheads

**Selection:** Bounty Hunter

**ABV:**  56% ABV

**Age:** 20 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich toffee, sweet cream. Candied almonds and walnuts. Thick syrupy fruits and very prominent sherry sweetness. Toffee, creme brulee and vanilla bean. Light musty tobacco.   

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, and there is some light heat. Sweet pears, prunes, currant and figs. Rich toffee notes. Musty pipe tobacco, light sulfur. Musty leather. Caramel. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and sweet. There is some ethanol here as well, but it is not punishing. Rich amaretto, toffee, butter cream, stewed fruits and musty richness. 

**Overall:** This is a very strong bottling, and one I wish I had backups of. This is a very complex, older sherried offering and it nails what it sets out to do. If the ethanol was a bit less apparent, this would easily climb an additional rank. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
