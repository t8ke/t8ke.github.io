**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of spirit distilled at Glenrothes distillery. It was distilled in 1973, and bottled in 2013 by Gordon & MacPhail. It was bottled at 43% ABV with no coloring or filtering. This is an old one, and my oldest Glenrothes to date, so I'm curious to see how it is. Lets dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Glenrothes

**Bottler:** Gordon MacPhail

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 40 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Fresh baked bread, vanilla bean, honey, light toffee. Some pepper, light fruits. Not super bold overall. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel, some honey. Fresh cake batter, light raspberry, cherry, vanilla bean. Nice pepper influence. Apples and pears. 

**Finish:** Short, lots of yeast, baked goods, faint cocoa. Not super intense. Toffee, apples, caramel. 

**Overall:** This is very nice but quite muted overall. I love this but canâ€™t help but wonder how some extra proof could help it. That said, this is far from bad, and its ranking shows. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
