**Nose:**  Sweet honey, lemon zest. Fresh baked cake, light vanilla. Lime, brine and soapstone. The essence of a nice riesling overall, but with much more ethanol involved. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Honey, brine, pepper, light sulfur. Faint ash, burning wood. Chalky, mineral, soapstone. Fresh baked cake. Really hot despite the proof. Earthy. Sweet vanilla bean.

**Finish:** Short, not super complex here. Lemon lime, ash, soapstone, light peat. Not a smoke bomb by any means. 

**Overall:** Nice, and fairly unique, but it grew more disjointed, and a bit hotter than Id like, near the end.

Thanks for reading!
