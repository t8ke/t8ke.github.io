**The Schtick:** Distilled from hand smashed agave distilled in small clay pots, this release created by Tio Pedro Hernandez. This batch produced 135 liters after being double distilled. Let's see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** 5 Sentidos

**Bottler:** 5 Sentidos 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  51% ABV

**Age:** NA 

-----

**Nose:**  Vinegar, olives, blue cheese. Crisp brine, vanilla bean. Stanky agave and a dry martini crossed in the middle. Super fun nose. Cream cheese frosting for days. 

**Taste:** Rich mouth feel. Honey, wafer cookie. Lots of rich creamy sweetness before the funk rolls in. Clay, brine, olive, earth and a lovely savory note. Faint pepper. Heat very much in check. The clay character is really something. 

**Finish:** Long, meaty. Smoked beef, tomato, vinegar and a chalky vegetal exit.

**Overall:** All over the board in the best way. I can’t think of anything i’ve had that is like this. I love how diverse and interesting it is. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
