**Nose:**  Honey, caramel, cashew, vanilla bean. Light clove, pretty pleasant overall. Not super hot, with a good variety of flavor. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Honey, pears, vanilla. Creamy caramel and nougat. Tame rye spice, but it blends well with the temparament of the rest of the notes. Really tame overall, with lots of good flavor. Nothing is massive or punchy, but its well rounded. 

**Finish:** Medium in length. Mellow ethanol. Honey, toffee, pralines, light clove. Not floral or herbal, lots of clove and allspice. 

**Overall:** This is really nice. Probably the best craft I've had in some time. This is getting me pumped for fall. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
