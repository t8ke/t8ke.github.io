-----

**Distiller:** Tamdhu

**Bottler:** Old Malt Cask

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:** 56.7% ABV

**Age:** 20 Years

**Nose:**  Apples, pears, rich molasses. No ethanol here, lots of fresh baked bread and dough. Caramel, nougat, nice butterscotch. Faint cocoa. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Light heat. Some salt, light pepper. Honey, apples, caramel and nougat. Definitely a good bit of oak, but well integrated. Brings good structure. Heat grows with time, but not unreasonable. Apples and pears are still pretty pervasive. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and savory. The fruits and caramel give way to rich pipe tobacco, oak, figs and currants. The transformation is really delicious, and it finishes with lots of currant, cherry, vanilla bean and oaky pipe tobacco. 

**Overall:** Delicious and really interesting. Certainly one of the more interesting Tamdhu's that I've had. The transition from nose to finish was really welcome, and I think this is a great buy. 

Thanks for reading!
