**The Schtick:** I tasted this dram blind and then got the reveal at a later time, so keep that in mind as you read through these notes.

-----

**Distiller:** Copper & Kings

**Bottler:** Copper & Kings

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  64% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Really sweet. Super apple forward. Maybe a brandy of one form or another. 

**Taste:** Super sweet. High proof. Good deal of ethanol. Then the tannic, dry oak sets in. Searing heat. Cherries, vanilla, cocoa. 

**Finish:** Long but hot and powerful. Younger. Some peanut brittle, some apple, some caramel. 

**Overall:** This is weird and all over the place. Hot, tannic, fruity. I guess it could be an ECBP or Stagg Jr, but I don't know. I don't like it as much as either. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
