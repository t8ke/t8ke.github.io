**The Schtick:** WhistlePig is a hybrid spirits operation in Vermont that has previously staked its claim on importing rye whiskey from Alberta to age and bottle in Vermont. In the past, Ive bumped into some of their single barrel ryes and found them really enjoyable. In recent months, WhistlePig has made a switch to digging up some older MGP rye stock for their 10 year old single barrel barrel proof rye, as well. As a result, I have set out to try 25 WhistlePig single barrel ryes to get a lay of the land.  They were arranged, poured and blinded by a generous fellow who loves rye as much (or very plausibly more so) than I do. There are one or two non-WhistlePig ryes in here, also, so the stakes are pretty high. All blind, all in. Welcome to the 2019 Ryenaissance.

-----

**Nose:**   Rich carmel, honey, toffee and fresh baked bread. Sweet red licorice note. Candied fruits, namely orange. Sweet vanilla bean. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Good ethanol presence. Good oak structure. Vanilla, cocoa, light plum, honey and cream. Lots of toffee. Light fig. 

**Finish:** Long but a bit hot. Lots of oak, cocoa, fig and orange. Sweet honey, toffee, caramel. Slightly bitter. 

**Overall:** This is also interesting. Really off profile for Alberta. Doesnt seem like MGP. Nice balance of sweets, fruits and spice. 

Thanks for reading!
