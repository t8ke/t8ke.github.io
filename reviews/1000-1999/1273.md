-----

**Distiller:** Ben Nevis

**Bottler:** Hidden Spirits

**Selection:** The Whiskey Exchange

**ABV:** 55.3% ABV

**Age:** 13 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich, sticky, syrupy, saturated sherry. Dense, sweet and desserty. Cocoa, honey, fig, blackberry. Apricot, vanilla bean. Smells like dessert. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. A bit of heat. Coffee, toffee, figs and stewed fruits. Lots of pepper and sulfur. Heat grows. 

**Finish:** Long, a bit of ash. Honey, soapstone, charcoal, light ash. Light syrupy fruity sweetness. Dry, oaky, peppery. 

**Overall:** What a transformation. The nose was absolutely intoxicating. The palate, less so. A bit hot, a bit dry. The finish was smoky, dry and hot. I wish I could smell this all day but the palate and finish can’t keep up. 

Thanks for reading!
