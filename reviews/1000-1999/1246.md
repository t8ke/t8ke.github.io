**The Schtick:** I tasted this dram blind and then got the reveal at a later time, so keep that in mind as you read through these notes.

-----

**Distiller:** Midleton

**Bottler:** Midleton

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, fresh baked bread. Vanilla, light pepper. Some oak, not a ton. Lighter. 

**Taste:** Scotchy, lightly ashy. Honey, toffee, pear, apple, vanilla bean. Caramel and caramel apple. 

**Finish:** Apples, pears, light ash, pepper, nice oak structure. 

**Overall:** Nothing tremendous but very solid. Guessing a GKS of some sort, although there is a little tiny bit of ash in there that confuses me, .

Thanks for reading!
