**The Schtick:** This is a special, from the distillery, sample of Jack Daniels bourbon at 53.5% ABV used for the Angels Share tour. A real fun experiment, so lets see how it is. I do not have cask information regarding which barrel this came from. 

-----

**Distiller:** Brown-Forman

**Bottler:** Brown-Forman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 53.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Powerful honey, honey roasted peanuts, bananas foster and an unprecedented vanilla bean note. Delicious bready and sweet, with some savory character as well. 

**Taste:** Honey, apples, bananas, raspberry. Vanilla bean, toffee, caramel and butterscotch. Reminiscent of old ND spirit and bananas in a blender. Weird, but great mouth feel with great oak structure,. 

**Finish:** Medium, rich and loaded with banana. A bit more one noated here with peanut and banana dominating. 

**Overall:** I really like this, but I can see that this is likely polarizing. The peanuts are wild, and the banana is at a crazy level I've not had in their spirit before. I love this, but agree this likely won't appeal to everyone. Great, though. 

Thanks for reading!
