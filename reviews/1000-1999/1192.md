[**Review #1192 | Sotol Review #22 - Flor del Desierto Sierra Sotol **]( https://t8ke.review/review-1192-flor-del-desierto-sierra-sotol/)

**The Schtick:** This is a Sotol produced by Jose Armando Fernandez Flores using Dasylirion Wheeleri that was grown in Madera. An interesting note is that the plants are mashed in the final stage by hoof - using cows. Weird, but what Sotol isn't? Let's dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Jose Armando Fernandez Flores

**Bottler:** Flor del Desierto Sotol

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 47.5% ABV

**Age:** NA 

-----

**Nose:**  Grassy, sweet and floral, honey. Light pepper, lemon. 

**Taste:** Minty, cassia, sweet honey, clay and earth. Brine. Floral. Weird chemical note. 

**Finish:** Short, super flora. Effervescent. Weird chemical note and spearmint. 

**Overall:** Wild crazy, all over the place, off the wall. I want to like it, but I'd need to be in a specific mood for this dram. Interesting stuff, but not every day, that's for sure. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
