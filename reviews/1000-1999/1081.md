**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottler release of Glengoyne spirit. It was distilled in 1996 and bottled after aging for 18 years. 

-----

**Distiller:** Glengoyne

**Bottler:** The First Editions

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 50.3% ABV

**Age:** 18 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Waxy fruits, vanilla, honey. Light smoke, pepper, some tobacco. Syrupy Dole fruit cocktail syrup. Pears, apples, lightly lactic. Really not what I was expecting at all. 

**Taste:** Medium body, no real heat. Sweet cream, bitter pepper, clove. Apples, pears and fig, with light smoke. Good structure over all. Some brine, although light - more mineral-y. This is really weird, and I have to admit that I didnt expect any of these notes with this dram. Very different than Glengoyne that I can get by me. 

**Finish:** Long, rich, no heat. Vanilla, pepper, minerals and soapstone. Sweet cream, mild ash. 

**Overall:** Wow. This was so very different than I was expecting than when I bought this on FineDrams. I expected an 18 year old syrupy sherry expression, and what I got instead was a delightfully complex, lightly smoky, fruit juice bomb. Really interesting. Of course, if I had heavily researched this before buying, I would have seen that First Editions is an IB, and this would have all made more sense. 

Thanks for reading!
