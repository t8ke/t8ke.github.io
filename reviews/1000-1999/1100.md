**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of spirit distilled at Wild Turkey. Bottled at cask strength with no filtering, this release from Single Cask Nation is 10 years old and bottled at a healthy 61%+ ABV

-----

**Distiller:** Wild Turkey

**Bottler:** Single Cask Nation

**Selection:** Single Cask Nation

**ABV:** 61.7% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Clove, rich cocoa. Anise, confectioners sugar, light orange peel. Sweet, earthy. No real ethanol. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No real heat. Sweet cocoa, lots of oak, rich cocoa. Faint citrus, bitter earthiness. Anise is gone, sweetness as well. 

**Finish:** Medium in length, growing more bittler. Lots of oak, some astringency, drying and tannic. Light orange peel. Clove, pepper, tobacco. 

**Overall:** I absolutely love the nose on this, but the palate and finish are total bitter bombs which really doesnt jive with my palate. Its unfortunate, and undoubtedly a huge hit to those who like bitter oak structure and tannic flavor bombs but this is too dry to really be something Id reach for again. 

Thanks for reading!
