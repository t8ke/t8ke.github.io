[**Review #1183 | Mezcal Review #19 - Del Maguey Tobala**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1183-del-maguey-tobala/)

**The Schtick:** This is a limited edition release of MX only Del Maguey Tobala. I don't have a ton of information on it, since it came to me via a friend, in the form of a bottle with a masking tape label. It was never produced in an official US bottling run, so that's the best of what I have to go off of. Let's see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** Don Rogelio Martinez Cruz, Leopoldino Miranda

**Bottler:** Del Maguey

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NA 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet, loaded with brine and light acidity. Effervescent and bright, loaded with pepper and citrus. Really pungent, in a floral, fruity way. 

**Taste:** Sweet, earthy. Rubber, fresh baked dough, sweet and savory vinegar. Light earth, not too chemical forward. Bit of agave stank/funk. The complexity is astounding. 

**Finish:** Short, but complex and incredibly clean. The vinegar and earth blend with confectioners sugar and orange peel, leaving with a quick wisp. Intensely drinkable. 

**Overall:** Big fan of this bottling, from the big hit of citrus on the nose to the stanky palate and incredibly clean finish. Really well done here. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
