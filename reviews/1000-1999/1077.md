**The Schtick:** WhistlePig is a hybrid spirits operation in Vermont that has previously staked its claim on importing rye whiskey from Alberta to age and bottle in Vermont. In the past, Ive bumped into some of their single barrel ryes and found them really enjoyable. In recent months, WhistlePig has made a switch to digging up some older MGP rye stock for their 10 year old single barrel barrel proof rye, as well. As a result, I have set out to try 25 WhistlePig single barrel ryes to get a lay of the land.  They were arranged, poured and blinded by a generous fellow who loves rye as much (or very plausibly more so) than I do. There are one or two non-WhistlePig ryes in here, also, so the stakes are pretty high. All blind, all in. Welcome to the 2019 Ryenaissance.

-----

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** Smooth Ambler

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 58.5% ABV

**Age:** 11 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Rich baking spices. Pepper, clove, almost light cardamom. Lots of oak and pipe tobacco. Faint caramel. 

**Taste:** Sweet caramel. Light toffee. Lots of oak, faint melon. Orange peel and light citrus. Some vanilla cream. The melon note is really interesting on this one. Medium mouth feel with no heat in the palate. Really mellow. 

**Finish:** Medium length. Heat is still very much well behaved here. Lots of vanilla, cream and melon here. 

**Overall:** Really off profile in a delicious way. Im a big fan of this one, especially given how different it is. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
