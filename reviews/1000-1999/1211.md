**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of spirit distilled at Mannachmore and bottled by the Scotch Malt Whisky Society. Bottled at cask strength without coloring or filtering, this expression spent 10 years maturing in ex-bourbon. I tasted this dram blind and then got the reveal at a later time, so keep that in mind as you read through these notes. 

-----

**Distiller:** Mannachmore

**Bottler:** SMWS

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  61% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years

**Nose:**  Sweet apple, spicy clove. Vanilla, honey, light melon. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. A bit hot. Honey, apples, pear, sulfur and pepper. Growing very hot with time, light ash note. 

**Finish:** Short, with loads of pepper, honey, and saering heat. Light sulfur, some vanilla bean. It's a hot one. 

**Overall:** I want to like this but it is too young and rough around the edges. It's a searing heat throughout the dram that really detracts from the key flavors. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
