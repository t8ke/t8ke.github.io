**The Schtick:** This is an age stated expression from Dewars. It is aged for 12 years, although filtered and colored. It is bottled at 40% ABV  and supposedly aged in "selected oak casks". This was on sale locally for $17, so I took a flier to see how it is.  

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Dewars

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, vanilla, light grainy notes. Light ethanol, honey, pear, faintly lactic. Almonds. 

**Taste:** Thin, mild ethanol. Caramel, toffee, vanilla and confectioners sugar sweetness. Light grain, some apple and pear. Surprisingly not bad. 

**Finish:** Short, not super complex. Honey, toffee, pear. Light almond. Some ethanol. 

**Overall:** This is by no means the best scotch in the world, but its surprisingly solid and makes for a solid easy drinker. That said, it does have some weak spots. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
