**The Schtick:** "Kentucky- A single barrel bourbon hand-picked by local Total Wine experts, aged in new American Oak barrels and finished in Chappellet Pritchard Hill Cabernet Sauvignon casks. Nose is reminiscent of this exquisite Napa Valley wine, with hints of caramel and spicy oak on the finish." - Total Wine+
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         +
So we have a Jeffersons release, matured in Cabernet casks, and chosen by Total Wine. This could be interesting. 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Jeffersons

**Selection:** Total Wine

**ABV:** 45.1% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, fresh red berries, oak, vanilla. Light raspberry. Some ethanol. Not a ton going on here. 

**Taste:** Thin, no heat. Oak, light toffee, some faint berry. Astringency and heat. 

**Finish:** Short but hot. Not a lot going on here. Faint vanilla and berries. 

**Overall:** A hot, boring dram. Unfortunately not something really interesting or exciting, especially given how much heat was there. 

Thanks for reading!
