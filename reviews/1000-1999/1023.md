[**Review #1023 | Rye Review #530 - The French Quarter: Finished Sazerac Rye**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1023-the-french-quarter-finished-sazerac-rye/)

**The Schtick:** This is a custom barrel aged release from a member of the bourbon community. It is based on Sazerac Rye and sees various maturation times in a variety of casks. 

-----

**Distiller:** Buffalo Trace

**Bottler:** Buffalo Trace

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  42% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Honey, clove, rye spice. Pepper and cardamom. Light stewed fruits. 

**Taste:** Think to medium mouth feel, clove and pepper. Earthy and dry, nice oak presence. Spices, almost potpourri like. Cardamom and citrus, namely orange peel.

**Finish:** Short to medium in length, mild heat. Rye spice, tobacco, really earthy. 

**Overall:** This is a good development on the Sazerac Rye base spirit, but I think it needs some work. Its too earthy and certainly too thin, which leads me to believe that more rigorous maturation conditions may have been useful given how long it spent in the barrel.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
