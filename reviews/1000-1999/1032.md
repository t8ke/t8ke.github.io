**The Schtick:** This is a limited edition expression from Glenmorangie that features the spirit being finished in Madeira casks. 

-----

**Distiller:** Glenmoranngie

**Bottler:** Glenmorangie   

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Honey, fresh baked bread. Vanilla bean, toasted almonds. Jammy fruits like currant, blackberry and raspberry.

**Taste:** Sweet vanilla, toffee, cream and pepper. Clove, baking spice. Light bitterness. Faint jammy fruits, but not nearly as present as the nose would have suggest. Thin to medium mouth feel. Very little heat. 

**Finish:** Short, Lots of fig, vanilla, buttercream. Light toasted almond. Not a lot going on here. 

**Overall:** Enjoyable enough but it seems to suffer from the same weakness as many other Glenmorangies: solid enough nose / palate but a totally weak and unremarkable finish. There was nothing bad about this dram, but there was nothing super compelling, either. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
