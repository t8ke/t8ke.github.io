**The Schtick:** This is a bottling of high ester rum for LMDWs 60th anniversary. Bottled at cask strength after 10 years of aging, this Savannah distillate is supposed to be pretty unique. Let's dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Savanna

**Bottler:** Velier

**Selection:** La Maison du Whisky

**ABV:** 63.8% ABV

**Age:** NA 

-----

**Nose:**  Powerful and sweet. Molasses, honey, toffee and coconut. Sweet banana and papaya, with a bit of ester bite. Lightly rotting character hits the nose, but this is mostly a sweet pina colada banana bomb blended with sweet molasses and honey. 

**Taste:** Super sweet, light mint. Honey, banana, coconut and plum. Really interesting and savory. Grows jammy and juicy, almost syrupy over time. Then the cough syrup notes hit. Like a powerful throat lozenge. 

**Finish:** Long, powerful but growing away from something I enjoy. The syrupy fruits are like cough syrup, complete with the menthol finish. 

**Overall:** This started in a place I loved, and quickly went to a place I didn't. A bummer, but it's just not for me. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
