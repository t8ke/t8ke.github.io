-----

**Distiller:** Linkwood

**Bottler:** The Ultimate Whiskey Company

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** 6 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet buttered rolls. Fresh baked cake. Donuts and icing. Sweet but also savory. Some salted caramel, briny and rich. Creme brulee. 

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel. No heat. Really weird, but interesting. Banana - loads of it. Sweet banana pudding. Vanilla is very prominent with light fruits like plantain, light apple and some faint fig. Really sweet. Honestly tastes like a banana split sunday. But not in an artificial way like banana in Jack Daniels distillate. 

**Finish:** Medium in length, very mild. Rich tropical fruits like banana and coconut followed by light brine and loads of sweet vanilla cream. 

**Overall:** This tasted more like a banana split / pina colada than anything, which was wild, but also strange. Im not sure how long it would take me to kill a bottle of this, but I also didnt dislike it either.  

Thanks for reading!
