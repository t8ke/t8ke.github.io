[**Review #1144 | Gin Review #17 - Tanqueray Malacca **]( https://t8ke.review/review-1144-tanqueray-malacca/)

**The Schtick:** "Relaunched in early 2013, Tanqueray Malacca is a sweeter gin with less juniper emphasis and more citrus than the classic style. Originally introduced in the late 1990s, Malacca was discontinued after a short lifespan but has been resurrected after gradually assuming cult status among cocktail revivalist bartenders as a good substitute for the original Old Tom styles of gin." - TWE. So we have a relaunch of a classic expression of an Old Tom gin from Tanqueray. Lets dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Tanqueray

**Bottler:** Tanqueray

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet and creamy. Lots of vanilla, juniper, white pepper and floral peach. Very sweet nose.

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, no real heat. Lots of sweet cream, peaches, cucumber, white pepper. Very floral.

**Finish:** Short but complex. Lots of grassy floral character, along with sweet cream, light peach and orange peel notes and white pepper.

**Overall:** Overall, I really enjoy this. Its great neat, on the rocks or in a cocktail. The floral, peppery character plays very well with the fruity peach notes and manages to serve up a very unique set of flavors for a gin. 

Thanks for reading!
