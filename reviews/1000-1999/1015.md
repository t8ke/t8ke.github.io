**The Schtick:** I tasted this blind, and was given the review after supplying notes. 

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** Coxs

**ABV:** 62.9% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Light, effervescent. Spicy up front. Cloves, pepper, some faint honey. Orange peel, light citrus. Faint vanilla cream. 

**Taste:** Thick mouth feel, mild heat. Definitely higher proof, but not punishing. Lots of honey, clove, toffee and some maple. That orange note is here again but its not punishing. Faintly earthy, but not too bad. 

**Finish:** Short in length, but powerful and rich. Brown sugar, light cherry cola. Faintly earthy. Rich tobacco, some oak structure. Vanilla, and maple, return. 

**Overall:** Overall, I liked this. This is definitely a moderately aged barrel proof bourbon. If I had to guess, I would say its likely Stagg Jr or an Elijah Craig Barrel proof batch Ive not had. It could be a less spicy Four Roses Single Barrel, but that has a signature spice profile I can usually pick out. Im going to guess that this is a bourbon, it is 10-12 years old, and its bottled around the 62% - 67% ABV mark.  

Thanks for reading!
