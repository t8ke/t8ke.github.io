-----

**Distiller:** Mortlach

**Bottler:** Gordon MacPhail

**Selection:** Binnys

**ABV:** 58.4% ABV

**Age:** 19 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet toffee, honey, nougat, pralines, amaretto and syrupy fruits. Dates, currant, rich syrupy grape, some cherry. Very sweet, pungently sherried. 

**Taste:** Thick, rich, and very flavorful. Lots of syrupy blackberry and currant, pipe tobacco, oak and toffee. There is some heat, but nothing crazy. Lots of sweet dessert notes balance well with strong oak body and musty pipe tobacco. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and rich. Pipe tobacco, oak, honey, grapes and currants. There's some nuttiness here, some amaretto, but overall its a syrupy fruit bomb. 

**Overall:** Really decadent, really complex, without leaning into the cloyingly sweet category. Really phenomenal. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
