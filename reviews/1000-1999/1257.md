**The Schtick:** This is a 12 year old, core line expression, from anCnoc. Featuring lightly peated malt, this is an interesting crossover in profiles that usually see themselves fairly well separated.

**Distiller:** knockdhu

**Bottler:** knockdhu

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, lemon, ethanol. Ginger root, vanilla bean, sweet freshly baked bread. Light pears and apple. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Really nice butterscotch note. Toffee, honey, pears, figs and sweet currant. Mild ethanol here. Faint pipe tobacco. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length. Sweet honey, fresh baked bread, apples and ginger and cinnamon. Nice stewed fruits note. 

**Overall:** This is really nice, all things considered. Id probably take this against 12 double wood and some other base 12 year expressions. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
