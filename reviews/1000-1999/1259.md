**The Schtick:** "Drum roll, please! It's this year's limited edition Ardbeg release for Ardbeg Day, Ardbeg Drum! Released at Fèis Ìle and around the world, the single malt brings together the best of both Islay and the Caribbean, as it was matured in bourbon casks and then treated to a finish in casks that previously held rum."-Ardbeg's Website. So, we have an Ardbeg matured in rum casks. This is the Committee Release, so it's at full proof. Let's dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Ardbeg

**Bottler:** Ardbeg

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  52% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Pungent and peaty. Loads of vanilla, fresh baked bread, light funky esters. Honey, banana, light lemon and lime. Faint crushed stone. Overall, it's pretty typical Ardbeg with just a hint of rum. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, a bit of ethanol. Sweet and creamy, with lots of pear, ash, bandaid, lemon, orange peel and moss. The funk from the nose here is more or less absent, in a strange plot twist. 

**Finish:** Medium length finish - lots of earth here. Vanilla, citrus, and damp earth steal the spotlight, with most other fruits and the rum character falling off entirely. 

**Overall:** This isn't bad, but its disjointed and strange, withouth a lot of cohesive notes to tie it together. I'd take Uuigedail or Grooves or just about any Ardbeg ahead of this because all of them feel better integrated to me. 

Thanks for reading!
