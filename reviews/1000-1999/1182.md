**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of distillate produced at Old Pulteney. It is bottled without filtering or coloring at 43% by Gordon &amp; MacPhail as part of their "MacPhails Collection" line of releases.

-----

**Distiller:** Old Pulteney

**Bottler:** Gordon MacPhail

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** 21 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, plum, lemon, lime, salinity. Fresh baked bread, cake batter, vanilla bean. Light sourness, some acidity. No ethanol. Sweet tart candies. Really interesting.

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Honey, plums, apples, lime, salinity. Light bring here with some nice pepper. Light pipe tobacco. Oddly present ethanol for the proof. Some toffee.

**Finish:** Short to medium in length. Really interesting evolution here - lots of cocoa, honey, tobacco, musty sherry and some funky stewed fruits. The prickle of ethanol returns, as does some citrus and brine but the finish has lots of unexpected rich sherry notes. 

**Overall:** Really strange dram in a fun way, but with some disjointed character. Overall I like it better than I expected, but I dont know if Id really chase it over the OB Old Pulteney 21yr.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
