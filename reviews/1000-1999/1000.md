**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of distillate produced by the Clynelish distillery. It is bottled for the Dun Bheagan line by Ian Macleod, at cask strength, with no filtering or coloring. This bottling was aged in a sherry butt. 

-----

**Distiller:** Clynelish 

**Bottler:** Dun Bheagan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 49.5% ABV

**Age:** 27 Years

**Nose:**  Honey, caramel, toffee, bread-y baked goods, melons, pears, vanilla, faintly waxed fruits. Really vibrant, and complex. Lots going on here. Nice to see it not bludgeoned by over-sherrying. 

**Taste:** Thick, rich. Mild heat. Apples, pears, toffee, leather, tobacco. Light smoke, waxed fruits. Faint vanilla, lightly woody. Lots of rich sherry, syrupy figs and amaretto. More sherry here than on the nose, which is nice. Lots of diversity still. Really complex. Those waxed fruits showing up and mingling is delectable. 

**Finish:** Long, thick. Faint ash, lightly woody, pipe tobacco. Waxed fruits, tobacco, charcoal. Stewed fruits, pear, fig, dates and currants. 

**Overall:** Great, but not up to snuff with the other Clynelish Ive had, which was arguably epic tier, so not a big worry. Not to say its bad though. This was really great, and I feel no disappointment picking this for the #1000. The complexity of the nose and palate were really very nice.

Thanks for reading!
