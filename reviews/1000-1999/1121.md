**The Schtick:** This is a bottling of a run if 19 barrels of Kentucky bourbon. According to Calumet: "All barrels used are aged in a single, center cut rack from the ideal maturation location and conditions inside the rick house. This expression of the Calumet Farm Bourbon family is a true convergence of craftsmanship and flavor."

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Calumet

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  47% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Oak, honey, ethanol and strangely enough - Red Vine candies. Really strange. Sweet and fruity, more artificially so (not to imply this is dosed or flavored - it just smells like some artificially flavored candy out there) with a faint backbone of oak.

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel, gets a little better with time. No real heat, but its pretty flat. The oak is first to show, followed by some astringency, vanilla and some more red licorice candy. Almost even a bit of a Swedish Fish note. Truly weird. 

**Finish:** Short, not a lot of heat, but not a ton of complexity either. Oaky, dry, some vanilla and more persisting candy notes. 

**Overall:**  Honestly, I dont really know what to make of this. The age is apparent in the oak, but perhaps a hair heavy handed. Not really an issue. The candy fruit notes are crazy interesting though, although Im not sure I super love them.

Thanks for reading!
