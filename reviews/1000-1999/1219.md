**Distiller:** Linkwood

**Bottler:** Signatory Vintage

**Selection:** Bounty Hunter

**ABV:** 56.5% ABV

**Age:** 19 Years

**Nose:**   Honey, sweet cream, fresh baked bread. Lemon and lime. Light minerality. Sweet, fainy syrupy jam. Raspberry, orange peel, faint plum. Light salinity. 

**Taste:** Thick mouth feel. Rich syrupy fruits. Honey, pear, apple, raspberry. Some fig and cherry. Toffee, leather and faint pipe tobacco. Some light salinity. Rich and sweet with lots of sherry character. Minor heat, if any. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and sweet. Some sulfur, some bitterness. Good oak structure, lots of honey, fresh baked bread and pear and blackberry sherry notes. Little more dry and astringent here. 

**Overall:**  Overall, a great look at an uncommon distillery. The sherry touches are really enjoyable but the growing sufur presence over the dram is a bit of a downer. That said, still a big fan.

Thanks for reading!
