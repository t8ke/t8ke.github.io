[**Review #1248 | Bourbon Review #585 - Woodford Reserve Batch Proof 2018**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1248-woodford-reserve-batch-proof-2018)

**The Schtick:** I tasted this dram blind and then got the reveal at a later time, so keep that in mind as you read through these notes.

-----

**Distiller:** Brown-Forman

**Bottler:** Brown-Forman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 62.9% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Strong oak, cocoa, pepper, some cherry. Strong ethanol but nothing too wild. 

**Taste:** Thick, rich, but hot. Powerful oak, honey, cherry and toffee. A little oakier than I would expect, but the heat is there. Peanuts, tobacco. 

**Finish:** Long, hot and rich. Oaky, pepper, spice. Some vanilla, some tobacco but mostly ethanol and oak. 

**Overall:** This is good but a bit tannic and a bit hot. That said, I'm certain this is a barrel proofer, and on the oakier side, so I don't find either of those qualities to be excessive. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
