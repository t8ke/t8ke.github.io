[**Review #1185 | Scotch Review #401 - Old Pulteney 13yr 2004 Single Cask  **]( https://t8ke.review/review-1185-old-pulteney-13yr-2004-single-cask/)

**The Schtick:** This is a single cask of Old Pulteney spirit, bottled by Old Pulteney for KLWines in California. A rare expression, given that it is bottled at cask strength, which is uncommon for Old Pulteney. This is cask #231. 

-----

**Distiller:** Old Pulteney

**Bottler:** Old Pulteney

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:** 55.2% ABV

**Age:** 13 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet buttery caramel. Honey, pepper, lemon poppyseed. Butterscotch, salted caramel. Yum. 

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, honey, toffee, some heat. Ash, ethanol, pepper, light oak. 

**Finish:** Medium in length, but a bit hot. Honey, toffee, brine, oak, light ash and some cracked pepper. 

**Overall:** I like this but it's a bit hot, and fairly one dimensional. The nose was amazing, but unfortunately the palate and finish couldn't keep up. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
