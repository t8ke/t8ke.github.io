**Distiller:** Kilchoman

**Bottler:** Kilchoman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 5 Years

**Nose:**  Ash, charcoal, honey and stewed fruits. Really ashy and peaty, strong notes of burning wood and minerality. The jammy fruits are there but subdued behind the peat slap. Light coconut notes.  

**Taste:** Thick and rich. Apples, pears, currants, light blueberry. Then the peat rampages in again. Really potent ash, burning rubber, faint brine and minerality. Faint oak structure. Overall, a nice blend of jammy fruits and ashy goodness. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length. More peat than sweet, but some nice vanilla and red apple are here with blackberry to see it off. 

**Overall:**  Really enjoyable, with a good bit of complexity. I like the blend of peat and fruit, and this does pretty well balancing the two.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
