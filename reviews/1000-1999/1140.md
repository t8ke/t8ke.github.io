**The Schtick:** This is a distillery release of 16 year old distillate from Jura. It is likely bottled with both coloring and filtering, although not officially stated by packaging, etc. 

-----

**Distiller:** Jura

**Bottler:** Jura

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 16 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Fresh baked bread, musty grains, light sea air. Kind of sour, very young smelling despite the age. Malty. 

**Taste:** Thin, no heat. Malty, young. Unpleasant. Wet cardboard. Vanilla, honey, musty molding grains. 

**Finish:** Short, no heat. Copper, malty grains, musty cardboard. Honey, vanilla, light brine. 

**Overall:** This is not good. It's young, malty and mostly gross, with few redeeming qualities. That said, it's not the worst I've had, but it needs to come along way to compete with just about any other scotch on the market. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 3**
