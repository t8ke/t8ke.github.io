**Distiller:** Invergordon

**Bottler:** The Exclusive Malts

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 48.2% ABV

**Age:** 43 Years

**Nose:**  Honey, rich toffee. Apples, pears and fresh cut melon. Almost a honey dew note. Light pepper. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No real heat at all. Vanilla, rich toffee, and apple crumble. Heat grows mildly. Melon. Light pepper. Tobacco, rich oak presence. Pear. 

**Finish:** Long, mild tobacco. Faint musty character. Good oak structure without being overbearing. Apples, pears, vanilla bean, honey and faint toffee. 

**Overall:** This was really nice. Ive found a lot of older grain whiskeys to perform really well, and this was no exception. The fruitiness, the tobacco and musty character and the well balanced oak was very nice. I really enjoyed this. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
