[**Review #1213 | Scotch Review #415 - Talisker 8yr Old Particular **]( https://t8ke.review/review-1213-talisker-8yr-old-particular)

**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of spirit distilled at Talisker, and bottled by Old Particular for KLWines after 8 years of aging. Bottled at cask strength without coloring or filtering, this young Island spirit should be interesting. I tasted this dram blind and then got the reveal at a later time, so keep that in mind as you read through these notes.  Let's dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Talisker

**Bottler:** Old Particular

**Selection:** KLWines

**ABV:** 59.5% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Brine, pepper, honey. Light fresh baked bread. Some sulfur, but not much at all. Lovely salted caramel. 

**Taste:** Nice palate, but quite a bit of heat. Brash, powerful brine and salinity, along with some baked bread, light ash and some pepper. Honey, caramel and fresh berries round out the palate. 

**Finish:** Long, bit of heat, but pretty nice. Vanilla, toffee, brine and caramel are dominant with a good dose of pepper to close things out. 

**Overall:** This is really nice. A bit hot, so likely a bit young, but good balance and depth for its youth. 

Thanks for reading!
