**The Schtick:** WhistlePig is a hybrid spirits operation in Vermont that has previously staked its claim on importing rye whiskey from Alberta to age and bottle in Vermont. In the past, Ive bumped into some of their single barrel ryes and found them really enjoyable. In recent months, WhistlePig has made a switch to digging up some older MGP rye stock for their 10 year old single barrel barrel proof rye, as well. As a result, I have set out to try 25 WhistlePig single barrel ryes to get a lay of the land.  They were arranged, poured and blinded by a generous fellow who loves rye as much (or very plausibly more so) than I do. There are one or two non-WhistlePig ryes in here, also, so the stakes are pretty high. All blind, all in. Welcome to the 2019 Ryenaissance.

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Whistle Pig

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  43% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Remarkably different nose. Fruitier, almost a hair lactic. Younger smelling. Lots of moist wet grains, musty youth. Some ethanol. Melon and apples. 

**Taste:** Thin. Unpleasant first note. Wet cardboard. Gross malty grass. Young. Good bit of heat. Some vanilla. 

**Finish:** Short, hot and a bit one noted. Malty, apples and pears, malty grains and a pulpy note

**Overall:** Not a fan. Obvious youth. Grainy. Musty and malty in an unpleasant way. I was told that there may be one or two non-WP single barrels in here and Id have to say this is absolutely one of them. 

Thanks for reading!
