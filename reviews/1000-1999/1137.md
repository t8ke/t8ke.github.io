**The Schtick:** This is a well dated blend from Grants. This bottling is from the 1980s when this product line carried an age statement. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Grants 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 8 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Super rich sherry. Plums, vanilla, caramel, nutty toffee, figs and stewed fruits. 

**Taste:** Medium, no heat. Sweet toffee, fresh baked bread. Amaretto and toasted walnut. Really rich toffee again. Pipe tobacco. Musty and sweet. Rich currant, black berry, fig and plum. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and rich. Musty still, lots of sherry and rich cocoa starting to develop. 

**Overall:** Hot damn. No wonder blends were popular in the 80s. This was an incredible look back in time to a product that is nothing like you see today. Im honestly going to look for more of these at auction, now that I know how good they are. 

Thanks for reading!
