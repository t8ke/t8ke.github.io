**The Schtick:** A blend of 10yr OBSV, 13yr OBSF, 14yr OESV and 16yr OESK, this years limited edition falls on Four Roses 130th anniversary. Bottled at cask strength from a small lot of barrels, this bottle always goes fast at release, often commanding impressive secondary prices. Let's see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** Four Roses

**Bottler:** Four Roses

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 54.2% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, tobacco, big clove and some rye spice. Really nice, but super on profile for 4R with their herbal spicy note. Toffee, some vanilla, nice oak component. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Toffee, honey, big powerful spice. Rye, clove, nice herbal component. Lightly minty  before a significant molasses note. Musty tobacco rolls in with old oak. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length, clean dry finish. Little dry for me, a bit oaky and spicy with loads of clove, pepper, oak, light mintiness and some flower lavendar. 

**Overall:** This was an interesting dram. It kinda threw me around like a bull from time to time. Overall, I liked it, but it's a wild child in that it seems to be attacking several profiles, all over the place. The musty oaky tobacco note in the palate was absolutely delicious, though, and I think this earns good marks as a result. Not my favorite LE from them by a long shot, but I'm a fan nonetheless.

Thanks for reading!
