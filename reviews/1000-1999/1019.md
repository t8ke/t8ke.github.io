**The Schtick:** This is a single barrel, barrel proof release of Brown-Forman distillate produced for the Jack Daniels line of expressions. This particular barrel was selected for Woodmans Market, a local chain here in Wisconsin. 

-----

**Distiller:** Brown-Forman

**Bottler:** Brown-Forman

**Selection:** Woodmans

**ABV:** 65.9% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, graham cracker, waffle cone. Peanuts. Bananas. Oak and cocoa. The banana is notably present here, but a lot of the other notes are interesting and new - like the waffle cone.   

**Taste:** Sweet and total banana bomb. Laffy taffy. Some heat. Rich and viscous though. Oaky, clove, lots of baking spice. 

**Finish:** Long but really really hot. Bananas, cocoa, cloves, pipe tobacco, oak.  

**Overall:** Great also but the heat is definitely more imposing than it should be. This cant really tango with the Kenwood I recently reviewed. While this was less a favorite, I dont regret buying it, as these are usually pretty interesting. I dont know if things are changing for Jack Daniels, or not, but Im noticing in the last year or so that I am finding far less bad barrels of the single barrel barrel proof that I used to. Seems like theyre really trying to dial it in. 

Thanks for reading!
