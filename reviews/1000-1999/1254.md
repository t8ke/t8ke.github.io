[**Review #1254 | Bourbon Review #587 - Elijah Craig Gift Shop Bourbon "Grenade"**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1254-elijah-craig-gift-shop-bourbon-grenade)

**The Schtick:** This is a gift shop release of older Heaven Hill spirit. It doesn't carry an age statment, and the proof is always 125, but it is generally believed to contain older ECBP spirit. I'm looking forward to giving this a go, so let's dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Heaven Hill

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 62.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Oak, honey, orange zest. Pepper, pipe tobacco. A bit dry on the nose, but some nice savory richness here. 

**Taste:** Dry, oaky, loaded with cocoa and cherry. Dark chocolate, some orange zest. Faint syrupy fruit, like as if there was some faint sherry in there. Not a ton, just a wisp. Not too hot for the proof, surprisingly. 

**Finish:** Short, dry, a bit hotter than expected here. Really crisp, but dry. Wisps away. 

**Overall:** I think this nails the oak really well for a bourbon, and I was afraid an oakier ECBP would be too much for me. I think I'd take this over any of the recent ECBP's.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
