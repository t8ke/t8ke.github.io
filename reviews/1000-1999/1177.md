**The Schtick:** Wahaka is mezcal produced by a small group of acquaintances from Mezica. This expression is distilled entirely from Tobala, one of the smaller varietals. This is my first brush with Wahaka branded spirits, and I am very much looking forward to it. Let's dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Alberto Morales Mendez

**Bottler:** Wahaka Mezcal

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  42% ABV

**Age:** NA 

-----

**Nose:**  Crisp salinity and strong agave character. Sweet and savory, with a good bite of clay and pepper

**Taste:** NIce mouth feel with just a pinprick of ethanol. Earth, clay, really vibrant salinity. I love the lean here towards the salty side. Light grapefruit and leather. 

**Finish:** Short, but crisp and clean. Light ash, loads of brine, clay and pepper. Faint tobacco. 

**Overall:** Vibrant but savory. Nice balance, with lots of brine and earth. Pepper, clay and faint tobacco to close it out. Really a fan of the profile here. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
