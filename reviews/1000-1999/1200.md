**The Schtick:** This is a release of Armagnac distilled in 1933 at Baraillon. It cost a pretty penny, but was too cool to pass up. For those in the audience who were not alive in 1933, let's look over a couple cool facts about that year because there was a lot going on, and the world was very different than it is today. +

Wow. What a look back. This all happened the same time this spirit was distilled. Then that spirit sat and waited until just this year when it was bottled and sold. History is really cool. Let's dive in.

**Distiller:** Domaine de Baraillon

**Bottler:** Domaine de Baraillon

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 86 Years

**Nose:**  Crazy jammy, loads of brown sugar, maple, blackberry, currant, pepper, pipe tobacco. Syrupy over oaky.

**Taste:** Medium mouthfeel, no ethanol. Sweet and jammy. Fig, blackberry, strawberry, raspberry. Cocoa, pipe tobacco, fuji apple. Vanilla. Really wonderful oak and fruit balance which was not expected.

**Finish:** Short, crisp, clean. Honey, heather, apples, pears, blackberry, raspberry. Light oak note.

**Overall:** Really nice. I was concerned to no end this would be a bitter oak bomb. It wasnâ€™t.

Thanks for reading!
