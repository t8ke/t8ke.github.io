**The Schtick:** This was distilled in 2003 by the now affected Long Pond Distillery. They lost some barrels in a blaze but otherwise seem fine and should be back to us in a decade or two. I have all four releases in the series to review, and this is day two, so lets keep the party going. 

-----

**Distiller:** Long Pond

**Bottler:** Velier

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  63% ABV

**Age:** 15 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Brash, monstrous, potent. Brown sugar, sweet creme brulee. Banana, papaya, pear, apple, rotting fruit. Pungent, almost sour tomato. Really wild combination of notes in the nose here. 

**Taste:** Sweet and powerful. Very sweet. Also, a bit of heat. Rich creamy vanilla, toffee and then the beast is unleashed. Plastic, burning rubber, rotting fruits. Apples, pears, papaya. Caramel and then a huge hit of smoke. This is wild. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and rich. The brown sugar reemerges, with bitter rotting banana, and a plastic trashcan fire note. 

**Overall:** This rum paints a picture Ive never tasted before, and its powerful from start to finish. This is insane. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 8**
