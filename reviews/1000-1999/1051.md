**Nose:**   Thick rich toffee, werthers caramels, rich warm vanilla, massive fruit character. Pears, apples, melon, rich fig, plums. Its a cornucopia

**Taste:** Thick mouth feel. Little pang of ethanol, but restrained despite the monster proof. Sweet caramel, musty pipe tobacco, vanilla bean. Rich pear, stewed fruits, figs, plums, apples and light cherry body. Really interesting. Nice oak structure as well. 

**Finish:** Long, rich, really mellow despite the 60% ABV. Rich oak, honey, light oak. Some pepper, musty tobacco again.
