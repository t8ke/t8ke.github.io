[**Review #1160 | Cognac Review #44 - Vallein Tercinier Lot 89**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1160-vallein-tercinier-lot-89/)

**The Schtick:** This is a release from Vallein Tercinier. It is bottled at cask strength without coloring or filtering. The lot information leads me to believe this was distilled in 1989 and bottled in 2018, but with all things cognac, this could be a bit murky. Let's dive in and see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** Vallein Tercinier

**Bottler:** Vallein Tercinier

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 48.5% ABV

**Age:** 29 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Apple, white pepper. Light white wine notes. Honey, lemon, faintly earthy with some nice soapstone qualities. Bright and fruity with low acidity and no heat. Very little oak on the nose.   

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, with no heat here. Sweet, lots of honey and apple / pear and light melon. Faint sulfur, some oak. Faint splenda and spearmint note here which is interesting. Its sweet and herbal, with a hint of artificiality. 

**Finish:** Short, lots more heat here. Spearmint, apples, pears, light oak, splenda and plastic and astringency. 

**Overall:** Honestly not a fan of this. It tastes like a fake apple sugarfree gum and thats more or less the last thing I hope to find in a brandy. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
