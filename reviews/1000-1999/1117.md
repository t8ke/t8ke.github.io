**The Schtick:** "Agave Sierra Negra is a sub-varietal of the Agave Americana family. It takes up to 25 years to mature. Sierra Negra is quite rare. It was widely cultivated many years ago but due to the plants low seed yield, small amount of hijuelos (agave pups), and lengthy maturation time, agave Sierra Negra has been mostly abandoned in favor of Agave Espadin. Mezcalero Aquilino Garcias first batch of 100% agave Sierra Negra with Mezcal Vago was produced in April 2018 with just 7 agave pias that yielded 84 liters of mezcal. Each pia weighed an average of 315 pounds. They were harvested by hand from the Lomas de Cocoshle parcel, which belongs to Aquilinos brother Benito. After the agave hearts were roasted, they were left to rest for two weeks before being crushed and distilled." - MezcalReviews
