**Distiller:** Matter Distillery

**Bottler:** Matter Distillery

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 66.6% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**   Anise, almond, vanilla bean and cassia

**Taste:** Thick and rich mouth feel but at the cost of some serious heat. Sweet anise, honey, vanilla, light cassia. Mildly earthy but the anise dominates as would be expected.

**Finish:** Really long and powerful. Not too hot here, but the heat is present. Warming, sweet and medicinal with a nice hint of candied anise. Slight horehound. 

**Overall:** Overall really nice. The proof is powerful, and overall I have nothing to complain about. This is great neat, and I bet it would be good in cocktails as well.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
