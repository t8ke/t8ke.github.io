**The Schtick:** This is a single cask release from Deanston that is matured for 9 years in a Bordeaux cask, then bottled at cask strength without coloring or filtering.

-----

**Distiller:** Deanston

**Bottler:** Deanston

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 58.7% ABV

**Age:** 9 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Honey, oak, caramel and cocoa. Nice wine note - blackberry, currant and some tannins. A little more rich than expected for the youth but theres a lot going on. 

**Taste:** Thin, but no heat. Lots of juicy fruits. Blackberry, currant, peach and apricot. Lots of heat, though. Searing. Honey, vanilla, light oak.

**Finish:** Short, and very hot. Nice juicy berries, honey, caramel., tannins and some currant. But oh so hot.

**Overall:** This was good but entirely too hot and young for what it is. Good stuff, lots of wine influence but that heat needs to be tamed.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
