**Distiller:** Great Lakes Distillery

**Bottler:** Great Lakes Distillery 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  44% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Vibrant lemon, citrus peel, black pepper and juniper. Vanilla, creamy sweetness. Honey. Good hit of cardamom.

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No heat. Sweet cream, honey, lemon, herbal almond, coriander and juniper. By no means a juniper bomb. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and lightly sweet. Herbal and lightly citric focuses, the spice and pepper swoop in and exit nicely with one sizeable juniper punch.

**Overall:** Really great local offering and one I plan to continue buying on the regular. As far as gins go, Ive really grown to love this one, although it trends towards the pricier side from time to time. 

Thanks for reading!
