**The Schtick:** This is a bottled in bond release from Brown Forman in their vintage dated line of expressions. They dont say a lot about it, so I am curious if this differes significantly from Old Forester Signature. 

-----

**Distiller:** Brown-Forman

**Bottler:** Brown-Forman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, caramel, bananas, faint oak. Not super rich, but not flat, either. This also smells young and fruity - musty and really loaded with banana bread notes. 

**Taste:** Young and musty. Wet cardboard. Honey, brown sugar. Some pepper and tobacco. Lots of signature Old Forester banana. Good mouth feel, but a good bit of heat is the cost. 

**Finish:** Short, no real heat. Brown sugar, faint oak, some pepper and then its gone. 

**Overall:** Again, not bad, but definitely not remarkable. I prefer Old Forester Signature over this, as I think it has a bit more age despite all of the marketing going on here. This was rough and young tasting, for sure. 

Thanks for reading!
