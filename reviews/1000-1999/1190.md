[**Review #1190 | Sotol Review #21 - Flor del Desierto Cascabel Sotol **]( https://t8ke.review/review-1190-flor-del-desierto-cascabel-sotol/)

**The Schtick:** This is a Sotol produced by Gerardo Ruelas using Dasylilrion Leiophyllum with rattlesnake added to distillation. If Sotol wasn't already interesting enough, this was a compelling combination that I had to try. Let's dive in.

-----

**Distiller:** Gerardo Ruelas Hernandez

**Bottler:** Flor del Desierto Sotol

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  48% ABV

**Age:** NA 

-----

**Nose:**  Earthy, floral. Honey, bread, perfumey. Really effervescent and interesting. Strange, to say the least. 

**Taste:** Sweet. Brown sugar, vinegar. Beets, molasss, light ammonia. Dirty, earthy. 

**Finish:** Medium in length, but a bit hot and a good deal of earth. Molasses, pepper, light brine and clay. Interesting. 

**Overall:** Super unique. I kind of waffle between loving it and not loving it, but I like this more than the desert. Crazy unique. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
