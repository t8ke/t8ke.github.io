[**Review #1253 | Scotch Review #433 - Campeltown Blend Cadenheads PBS**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1253-campeltown-blend-cadenheads-pbs)

**The Schtick:** This was a living cask release from Cadenhead's gift shop. Comprised entirely of Campbeltown spirit, this blend is sure to be interesting. Bottled on May 30th, 2019 at cask strength. Let's see how it is. 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** Cadenheads

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 57.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Super sweet, with lots of fresh baked bread. Honey, toffee, creme brulee. Fresh cake batter and doughnuts. Honey, light pepper, faint citrus, sweet. 

**Taste:** Toffe, salinity, soapstone and light funk. Peaty sweetness, but really dialed back. Honey, pepper, sulfur. Lemon peel. 

**Finish:** Long, hot, but rich and ashy. Loads of oak, lots of burning wood. Dry and tannic. Fresh baked bread, icing and lemon. 

**Overall:** I like this but the transformation into the finish is too jarring to give a lot of complexity to this dram. One minute, its's sweet complex and balance. The next...it's consumed by ashy oak. It's good, but that disjointed quality will keep it from progressing further. 

Thanks for reading!
