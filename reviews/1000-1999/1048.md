**Nose:**   Syrupy Dole fruit syrup, pears, plastic, waxed fruits. Oddly Clylelish like. Toffee. Super buttery. I expected a big earthy mineral hit and theres hardly any of that here. Waffles. Bread-y buttery sweetness. 

**Taste:** Really sweet. Very prominent toffee, caramel, vanilla. Sweet, with some salty minerality. Light ash and smoke, but its faint. Rich apple pie notes: maple, apples, pastry.  

**Finish:** Short, ashy, some plastic notes here. More smoky than sweet. Light earthiness. 

**Overall:** This was a really unique dram, and very off profile for Ledaig. The monster fruit character and accompanying sweetness in the palate was really interesting, but I dont feel compelled to buy a bunch more. 

Thanks for reading!
