**Nose:**  Rich honey, oak, syrupy fruits. Cocoa, heavy tannins, tobacco and raspberry. Tons of vanilla and caramel. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel with some immediate heat. Honey, berries and oak are most priminent initially. Blackberry, currant, ethanol, vanilla, and heavy tanninc dryness. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length, loaded with berries and tons of tannins. The dryness here is inescapable, and the bitterness grows. The fruits are rich and syrupy, as is some essence of pipe tobacco, but ti's generally overshadowed by dry tannins. 

**Overall:** I love the nose on this but found the palate and finish less enticing as the tannins grew bolder and eventually took over. It's certainly an armagnac to target the bourbon community, and it checks a lot of boxes in order to effectively do just that. I'm keeping back an ounce of this to sit in a mostly empty bottle for 4-6 months to see if an abundance of oxidation helps to tame that bitterness, and bring out more underlying character, and I'll report back when I give it another go. 

Thanks for reading!
