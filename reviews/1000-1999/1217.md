**The Schtick:** This is a release of spirit distilled at Lous Pibous and bottled by L'Encantada, after selection by myself and others on behalf of Aficionados. Sold by Fine Drams, this bottling of French Armagnac is bottled at cask strength with no coloring or filtering. Lous Pibous is certainly a well known name in the brandy world, so I'll let it speak for itself. If you're curious about how we came to pick this cask, check out my log of Private Selections.

-----

**Distiller:** Lous Pibous

**Bottler:** LEncantada

**Selection:** Aficionados

**ABV:** 56.1% ABV

**Age:** 24 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, baking spices, fresh plum and pipe tobacco. Light oak, fresh juicy berries, raspberry, currant and blackberry. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, rich honey. Good deal of oak, but well integrated with honey, butter, and the juicy fruits. Pipe tobacco, musty sweetness and some 

**Finish:** Long, rich, lots of sweet syrupy fruit, musty sherry notes, pipe tobacco and red licorice. Strong oak structure, blending nicely with the sweetness. 

**Overall:** There's a reason we couldn't let this cask go and it shines here. The powerful fruit character, matched well with the oak structure made it a winning profile I'd seen from few Lous Pibous before. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: UNSCORED**
