**The Schtick:** WhistlePig is a hybrid spirits operation in Vermont that has previously staked its claim on importing rye whiskey from Alberta to age and bottle in Vermont. In the past, Ive bumped into some of their single barrel ryes and found them really enjoyable. In recent months, WhistlePig has made a switch to digging up some older MGP rye stock for their 10 year old single barrel barrel proof rye, as well. As a result, I have set out to try 25 WhistlePig single barrel ryes to get a lay of the land.  They were arranged, poured and blinded by a generous fellow who loves rye as much (or very plausibly more so) than I do. There are one or two non-WhistlePig ryes in here, also, so the stakes are pretty high. All blind, all in. Welcome to the 2019 Ryenaissance.

**Distiller:** Beam

**Bottler:** Beam 

**Selection:** Fred Noe

**ABV:** 57.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**   Big bold rye spice. Aggressive spice, clove, nutmeg. Some vanilla and honey. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, a bit of heat. Younger, almost mustier. Wet grains. Cardboard. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length. Not good. Musty wet carboard. Fresh bread, toffee, pepper, cloves. Wet grass. Bitter slow finish. 

**Overall:** I dont know what this is but its not a 10yr WP cask. And if it is, its not a good one

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 4**
