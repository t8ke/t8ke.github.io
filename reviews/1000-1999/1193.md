**The Schtick:** This is an annual re-release of a product line established by Macallan in 2017. Classic Cut is a NAS sherry expression from The Macallan that is bottled at cask strength. There is some concern that this release won't hold up against last years release (which I was quite fond of) but the only way to tell is to try it. Let's dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Macallan

**Bottler:** Macallan

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 51.2% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet nutty toffee, honey and sticky stewed fruits. Raspberry, dates, amaretto and currant. Nutty, sweet, sherry powerful. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. No real heat. Honey, toffee, rich stewed fruits. Sweet blackberry, currant, raspberry and fig. Light musty tobacco. 

**Finish:** Short, a bit hot. Not as much going on here. Toffee, faint stewed fruits, light astrigent plastic note. 

**Overall:** Oh how the mighty have fallen. I rebought several original Mac CC's but I think that I would easily skip over rebuying this. The most noticeable difference is in the finish. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
