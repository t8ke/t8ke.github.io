**The Schtick:** This is a single cask of brandy distilled by Laird's in New Jersey. Selected by Steve's Wine and Liquor in Madison, WI, this cask was bottled after 49 months of aging at cask strength, with no coloring or filtering.

**Distiller:** Lairds

**Bottler:** Lairds

**Selection:** Steves

**ABV:** 65.05% ABV

**Age:** 4 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet creme brûlée, honey, apple pie. Clove, cinnamon, lovely nuttiness. No ethanol after a standard rest. Sweet, surprisingly good complexity. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Some heat. Toffee, almonds, apple pie. Vanilla bean, leather, tobacco, faint cocoa. Really nice.

**Finish:** Long but searingly hot. There’s the ABV. Apples, clove, vanilla, some honey.

**Overall:** Absolutely amazing until the finish where the ABV shows off its power. With a couple more years in the barrel to tame this, I bet these will become phenomenal bottlings. In the meantime, though, I'll be buying several more of these to test cask variation and see how age affects these over the coming months and years. Lairds is a house to watch. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
