**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of grand champagne cognac distilled at Jean Fillioux. It was selected and bottled by La Maison du Whisky and was bottled without coloring or filtering at cask strength after 42 years of aging, if the lot number is to be taken as a vintage. 

-----

**Distiller:** Jean Fillioux 

**Bottler:** La Maison du Whisky

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 41.7% ABV

**Age:** 42 Years

**Nose:**   Syrupy and rich. Apple, pear, honey, fresh baked bread, musty pipe tobacco. Effervescent and fruity, lots going on. Strong apple and grape notes. 

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel, some heat. Lots of apple here, some oak structure. Light spearmint, which is really perplexing. Lightly syrupy, more floral and herbal than syrupy, compared to the nose, though.

**Finish:** Short, no heat. Sweet honey, cream, tobacco, syrupy fruits and a good deal of light musty leather. Faint brown sugar. 

**Overall:**  Really interesting and unique dram. Ive never seen so much syrupy fruits on a nose and finish that just disappear into hearbal savory notes on the palate. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
