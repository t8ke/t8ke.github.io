**The Schtick:** This is a single cask of Tomatin distillate that was bottled and released for Twin Liquors. It is 11 years old and was matured entirely in an ex-bourbon barrel. It is bottled without coloring or filtering, and at cask strength. 

-----

**Distiller:** Tomatin

**Bottler:** Tomatin

**Selection:** Twin Liquors

**ABV:**  54% ABV

**Age:** 11 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Honey, fresh baked bread. Plums, very faint salted caramel, buttered popcorn. Toffee, faint vanilla. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Light heat. Vanilla, cream, caramel and toffee. Fresh baked bread. Light brine, some pepper. No smoke. Faint pear and plum. Really interesting blend of brine and pepper with sweet creamy notes. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and peppery. Vanilla, savory tobacco. Light brine. Faintly lactic. 

**Overall:** Really enjoyable and unique for a lot of other Tomatins Ive had. Sometimes I bemoan things that are purely ex-bourbon maturation, but drams like these remind me of the merits. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
