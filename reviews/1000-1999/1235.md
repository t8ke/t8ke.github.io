**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Nose:**  Wet, musty, iodine-y peat. Vanilla cream. Honey, lemon, lime. Pepper, faint salt. The Caol Ila and Frog is definitely evident. 

**Taste:** Thin but no heat, Loads of cream, honey and pepper. Salinity, fresh baked bread, dead sea peat. 

**Finish:** Lemon cream, pepper, a slap of moist, seaweedy peat. Iodine, lemon drop. 

**Overall:** This is nice. I like it a lot. The palate could use more body, but this is a completely competent peat offering and I'd happily drink it again. 

Thanks for reading!
