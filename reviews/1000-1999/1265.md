**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of Ben Nevis distillate that was aged first for 12 years in sherry casks, and then further for 15 more years in a port pipe. It is bottled at cask strength without coloring or filtering.

-----

**Distiller:** Ben Nevis

**Bottler:** Le Gust

**Selection:** WhiskyBase

**ABV:** 58.9% ABV

**Age:** 27 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Bold and rich. Cocoa, apricot jam. Honey, figs and loads of sweey fruits. Raspberry jam, sticky stewed fruits. Light sulfur. Honey, confectioners sugar. The spice is subdued and well integrated, the tannins are present but not dominating. The port is particularly noteworthy here, with lots and lots of jammy fruit present.

**Taste:** Thick, rich. Sweet, but some heat here. Cocoa, honey, loads of vanilla bean. Then, the fruits storm in. Figs, grapes, peach, pear, currant and blackberry.

**Finish:** Medium in length, some bitterness and heat here. More wood here than in the nose and palate. It's drying and hot, but not without some fruit character for the road.

**Overall:** I really enjoyed this dram. The transitions were clear but enjoyable, although I wasn't as pleased with the finish as I thought I might be after the nose and the palate. A little less tannins and bitterness and this would be an easy rank higher. That said, this is complex and really quite a treat. I'm giving it a well earned 7

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
