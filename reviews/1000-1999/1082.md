-----

**Distiller:** Chateau du Breuil

**Bottler:** Chateau du Breuil

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 52.2% ABV

**Age:** 13 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Sweet apple, pear and melon. Light honey and confectioners sugar. Bright and effervescent. Light cinnamon note. Syrupy and sweet. Faint lactic character. 

**Taste:** Thin to medium mouth feel. Light prickle of ethanol. Apples, pears and a nice earthy quality. Light spearmint, almost. Faint pepper, some presence of oak. Generally leaning towards the bright green apple fruity side of the spectrum with little oak or must. 

**Finish:** Short to medium in length, only mild ethanol. The green apple note is still incredibly prominent with very little to hide behind it. Cloves, faint oak, some honey. 

**Overall:** Overall, this is unique and different. Not incredible, but very well made and a good representation of a well made calvados. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
