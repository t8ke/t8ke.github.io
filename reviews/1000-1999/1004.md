**The Schtick:** This is a Kilchoman release that is matured in an 80/20 ratio of Oloroso wine casks and ex-Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels. It is bottled at 46% abv without filtering or coloring and is named after one of the ricky inlets found north of Kilchomans distillery.

**Distiller:** Kilchoman 

**Bottler:** Kilchoman

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  46% ABV

**Age:** NAS

**Nose:**  Buttered popcorn, sweet sherry and stewed fruits. Honey and cream, lightly ashy. 

**Taste:** Ash, soap stone and stewed fruits. Campfire, burning wood. Medium mouth feel with light heat.

**Finish:** Medium length, ashy and fruity. Minerality is strong here.

**Overall:** While the sherry was noticeable in the palate, I would have liked some more. Overall, I like this a bit more than Machir and thought this was well done. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
