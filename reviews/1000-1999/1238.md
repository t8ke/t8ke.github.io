[**Review #1238 | Bourbon Review #584 - California Gold High Rye **]( https://t8ke.review/review-1238-california-gold-high-rye)

**The Schtick:** This is an interesting blend by an unknown party using unknown ingredients. At least to me. I have no idea of proof, components or age. So I guess this is mostly blind, other than the clue that it is high rye, which could mean more or less anything. Let's dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Various

**Bottler:** Undisclosed

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**    % ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Oak, pepper, pipe tobacco. Musty, cocoa, vanilla. Light fudge. Faint salinity. Melon. Clove. 

**Taste:** Some heat. Rich mouth feel. Cherry, raspberry. Pepper, clove, herbal rye spice. Vanilla, fudge, blackberry. 

**Finish:** Long but searingly hot. Filled with cocoa, fudge, blueberry and blackberry. Pipe tobacco and strong oak structure. 

**Overall:** This is really nice, with the caveat of too much heat, and a dominant clove note. That said, the fudge blended with the fruitiness is pretty impressive. This feels like it has some pretty good age, but without knowing the age, proof or components, I have nothing but my palate to work with. 

Thanks for reading!
