**The Schtick:** This is a special release of Vago Tobola that was Mexico only. A friend picked it up in his travels south of the border and shared some with me, which is super cool to try. Let's dive in. 

-----

**Distiller:** Aquilino Garcia Lopez, Emigdio Jarqu√≠n Ramirez

**Bottler:** Vago Mezcal

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** NA 

-----

**Nose:**  Huge, powerful, vegetal. Honey, melon, mint, really potent cilantro and grass earthiness. 

**Taste:** Sweet, loaded with honey, melon and pineapple. Earthy, and oddly artificial. Delicious clay and stanky agave blends with pepper, leather and vegetal funk. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and loaded with funky agave, green beans, caramel, confectioners sugar, pepper, and clay. 

**Overall:** Really unique and interesting, and certainly powerful. Loads of unique flavors, especially that rich vegetal note. I'm a fan. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 7**
