**Nose:**  Thick, rich, sticky raisin bread. Sherry, stewed fruits. Fresh baked bread, figs, dates. Some nice oak presence, light soap stone.  

**Taste:** Thick, and rich. No real heat despite the impressive proof. Ash, oak, currants and blackberry. Stewed fruits, honey and caramel. Rich mouth feel. Great structure. 

**Finish:** Long, sweet and rich. Sherry, good oak body here also. Light minerality. Some lightly ashy wood. 

**Overall:** Really impressive offering, showing how solid and interesting Irish can be. The combination of fruits, sweetness, light ash and the minerality made this interesting and delicious. Really good experience with this one. 

Thanks for reading!
