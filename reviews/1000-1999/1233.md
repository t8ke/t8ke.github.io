-----

**Distiller:** Glenturret 

**Bottler:** Glenturret 

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 62.3% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Rich currant, blackberry, cherry and honey. Pepper, tobacco. Rich syrupy fruits, with a nice spice undertone.  

**Taste:** Thick, rich mouth feel. Some mild heat. Drinks well below 62% ABV. Sweet honey, plum and almond. Then the fruits hit like a truck. Blackberry, fig, cherry, currant. Bright and fruity, loaded with rich stewed fruits. Some pepper. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and flavorful. Blackberry, graham cracker, pipe tobacco. Mild heat, although still tame compared to my expectation for the proof. 

**Overall:** Really interesting, complex and frankly great release from Old Particular. Really wishing I bought more of this one. 

Thanks for reading!
