**The Schtick:** This is an independent bottling of spirit distilled at Ledaig (Tobermory) and releases by Single Cask Seasons. This is bottled after being matured in first fill sherry for 1o years, at cask strength, with no filtering or coloring.

-----

**Distiller:** Tobermory

**Bottler:** Tobermory

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 60.6% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Fairly closed off. Honey, apples, pears, light fruits. Vanilla, light nutty character. Musty, funky.

**Taste:** Thick and rich. Sweet, honey and melon. Lots of sweet caramel, faint currant and raspberry. Then, the ash rushes in. Earthy, mineral forward peat here. Light ash. The heat grows with time. Almost punishing at the end. 

**Finish:** Long, but hot and definitely ash forward. Rubber, astringency, plastic, earthy soapstone. Minerality is big here with the smoke. Light honey and blackberry.

**Overall:** What a transition. This goes from sweet and unassuming to a fruit bomb to a total peat bomb. Really interesting progression and a really delicious dram.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
