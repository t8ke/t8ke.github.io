**Distiller:** Havana Club

**Bottler:** Havana Club

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years

**Nose:**  Sweet almond, toffee, caramel and root beer barrel candies. Honey, toasted nuts and sweet syrupy molasses. Overall, very sweet, but no heat and no astringency.   

**Taste:** Thin mouth feel, still no heat. Sweet toffee, pecans, caramel and more syrupy sweetness. The continuation of the sugar-y root beer candy is interesting. Overall, no astringency, very little oak body. Not bitter.

**Finish:** Short, loaded wtih cocoa, toffee and caramel. No heat.

**Overall:**  Thin overall and very sweet, but not terrible. This is more enjoyable than the US counterpart.

Thanks for reading!
