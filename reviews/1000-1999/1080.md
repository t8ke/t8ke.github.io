**The Schtick:** WhistlePig is a hybrid spirits operation in Vermont that has previously staked its claim on importing rye whiskey from Alberta to age and bottle in Vermont. In the past, Ive bumped into some of their single barrel ryes and found them really enjoyable. In recent months, WhistlePig has made a switch to digging up some older MGP rye stock for their 10 year old single barrel barrel proof rye, as well. As a result, I have set out to try 25 WhistlePig single barrel ryes to get a lay of the land.  They were arranged, poured and blinded by a generous fellow who loves rye as much (or very plausibly more so) than I do. There are one or two non-WhistlePig ryes in here, also, so the stakes are pretty high. All blind, all in. Welcome to the 2019 Ryenaissance.

**Distiller:** MGP/LDi

**Bottler:** WhistlePig

**Selection:** 5 Star Liquor

**ABV:** 58.2% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years 

-----

**Nose:**   Sweet cream. Light citrus. Fresh baked bread. Light herbs and a floral component I cant put my finger on. Almost a corn bread note. Interesting. 

**Taste:** Sweet and mild. More herbal notes here on this one. Thin to medium mouth feel, but the heat is mild as well. Honey, mint, caramel. Heat grows with time. 

**Finish:** Short in length, but very punishing in heat. Melon, mint, herbal notes. Flora. Less complex here than the others with heat making up more impression than anything else. 

**Overall:** This was nice, but couldnt perform nearly as well as others. The thinner mouth feel paired with a more searing finish and less complexity overall will hurt this one a bit. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
