**The Schtick:** This is a limited edition release from Bruichladdich on Islay that draws from a combination of casks to make up the 18,000 bottles for release. Spirit used for The Laddie Edition 2 is made up on distillate aged in Sherry casks, ex-bourbon casks and French wine casks. It is bottled without coloring or filtering.

**Bottler:** Bruichladdich

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 10 Years

**Nose:**  Honey, toasted almond. Light brine, pepper, fresh baked bread. It’s sweet, lightly nutty, faintly lactic and the sweetness and brine play very well.

**Taste:** Honey, toffee, light brine, sweet caramel. Faintly lactic, amaretto, rich pepper. Good body on the mouth feel, faint heat, if any.

**Finish:** Medium in length. No real heat to speak of. Lots of vanilla, pepper, lactic sea air as well as more rich toffee.

**Overall:** Really nice. I felt like this had more depth and body compared to the first edition, which I also enjoyed, but a bit less. There was more bready sweetness, more caramel and toffee and less lactic sour fruits, although they were not gone altogether. I generally like that oddly lactic Laddie profile, but it’s best in moderation. This nails that balance.

Thanks for reading!
