**Nose:**  Rich cocoa, honey, jammy fruits. Lots of oak here, really bold tannic backbone. Sweet grapes, light vanilla, faint herbal quality. Light cola note. No plastic or astringency. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. No real heat. Sweet, juicy grapes. Some currant, blackberry, blueberry. Light cocoa, strong oak presence. Not too dry, but its woody. Faint plastic note. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and sweet. Honey, tobacco, oak, herbal mintiness, blackberry and currant are dominant here, with a really unique showing throughout. 

**Overall:** I like this quite a bit since it preserves some of armagnacs most notable characteristics without becoming an oaky bourbon bomb. Thats a common complaint I have with some armagnacs. This is on the straight and narrow, though, and is delicious. 

Thanks for reading!
