**The Schtick:** Redbreast 12 is a pot stilled Irish whiskey that is matured in some percentage of sherry casks. It is bottled with coloring. 

-----

**Distiller:** Midleton

**Bottler:** Redbreast

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  40% ABV

**Age:** 12 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Toffee, leather, pepper, honey and fresh baked bread. Rich baking spices. Caramel.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Mild heat. Lots of honey, currant, raisins and toffee. Fresh baked bread. 

**Finish:** Long with good body. No real heat here. Toffee, caramel and figs make for a nice blend of flavors. 

**Overall:** This is super solid, and I think its one of the most approachable Irish whiskeys on the market right now. Rich, flavorful and generally affordable. Price not factored in, but compared to most Bushmills / Jameson products, I would find this to be superior. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 5**
