[**Review #1021 | Bourbon Review #529 - Old Ezra 7yr Barrel Proof**]( https://t8ke.review/review-1021-old-ezra-7yr-barrel-proof/)

**The Schtick:** This is a barrel proof release of what is most likely Heaven Hill distillate sourced by Luxco for the Ezra Brooks product line. It is age stated at 7 years old. 

-----

**Distiller:** Heaven Hill

**Bottler:** Luxco

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:** 58.5% ABV

**Age:** 7 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Corn, caramel, toffee and cloves. Some young graininess. Not a ton of ethanol.  

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Honey, corn, toffee, peanut brittle. Sweet vanilla. Some young grain, really nice ethanol presence though

**Finish:** Medium length. Corn, faint musty grain. Some cardboard. Toffee, pepper, cloves. Light bitterness on the finish. 

**Overall:** Not bad, even great, but not exceptional. Great value for what it is, but its no Stagg Jr. Im certainly impressed by it, though. Its not often we see a new barrel proof offering coming in to the market as a non-Limited release, or at a really reasonable price point like this bottle is bringing. I think its positive to see in the market as a lot of people are flocking to try it. Im certainly not disappointed with it and will likely seek out a replacement.   

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
