**The Schtick:** This is a Total Wine selection of single barrel bourbon that appears to be contract distilled for MB Roland brand in Kentucky by an undisclosed distiller. 

-----

**Distiller:** Undisclosed

**Bottler:** MB Roland

**Selection:** Total Wine

**ABV:** 53.5% ABV

**Age:** NAS 

-----

**Nose:**  Young, malty, musty, lactic. Gross, fruity, vanilla, juicy fruit. Almost sickeningly sweet.

**Taste:** Putrid, thin, musty, malty, incredibly sour lactose. Sweet cloying sugary.

**Finish:** Short, hot, loaded with gross youth, musty wet grains, soil, then suddenly sweet again.

**Overall:** This is disgusting and could duke it out with some select  TerrePure releases any day.

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 2**
