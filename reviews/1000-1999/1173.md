**Distiller:** Benrinnes

**Bottler:** Old Malt Cask

**Selection:** N/A

**ABV:**  50% ABV

**Age:** 19 Years 

-----

**Nose:**  Bready, yeasty, loaded with salt and pepper. Really intresting blend of honey sweetness and light savory qualities. No meatiness. Light minerality. 

**Taste:** Honey, apples, pears, salt and pepper. Fresh baked bread, some pepper, light sulfur, faint lime. Overall, its more bread and pepper than anything, with sweet undertones. 

**Finish:** Medium length finish, pepper, light light ash.

**Overall:** I like this, but it isn't powerful or super incredible. That said, its unique and pretty enjoyable. I'd drink it again. 

Thanks for reading!

**Rank: 6**
