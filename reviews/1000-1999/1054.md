**Nose:**  Sweet cake batter. Fresh baked bread. Rich honey and toffee. Light melon, starfruit, faint salt character. Almost smells like a briny melon gose. With sweet cake undertones. Really intriguing 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel. Sweet cream, vibrant pepper. Light heat, grows a little with time. Earthy, minerality, salt and caramel. Pepper, clove, faint ash. More cake batter. Intrigue continues. 

**Finish:** Long, rich and sweet. More earth and minerality, but no ash. Melon, lemon, earthy tobacco. Crisp and effervescent fruitiness with solid sweetness. Surprising oak body on the finish. 

**Overall:** This is one of the most intersting drams Ive had in a long time. I cant think of many things, if anything, Ive had like it in  recent memory. Really savory and delicious. 

Thanks for reading!
